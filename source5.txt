OM UCHISHTA MAHA GANAPATHEYA NAMAH

Esteemed Readers

I am extremely thankful to my preceptors who had taught me the basic anatomy of Astrology, a divine science.
I had a flair for writing from childhood, but probably was not encouraged enough to continue the writings.
Belonging to the Nair community of Kerala, traditlonally the community torch-bearers did not have much
background in the Astrological field in the past; nor anyone in my ancestor's family ever had practiced it.
But I had somehow got the notion of learning Astrology and offering predictions to people around me. In the course of same, I had learned Vedic and KP Astrology, besides, the Prashna "Kavadi" Shastra of Kerala.
At this juncture, expressing the gratitude, I should thank one and all, blessings of my parents, MK Nair and Smt. K Janakyamma, for this important event, and also the support rendered to me by all in order to complete compilation of this wonderful and divine subject.
While always at the feet to my gurus, Mr. Venugopal Sarma, Mr. K Babu Rao, Mr. PvK Punneswara Rro and Mr. Kameshwara Prasad, I acknowledge the consideration given to me by Mr. Rajendra Nimje, IAS, and fondly remember the cordlal association with KP International Astra Forum at Hyderabad.
 
viii	Basics of Nakshatra Padhathi (Marriage, Profession & Health)


I sincerely thank my Astro-f iends Mrs. Paripati Vijaya Reddy, Mr. Kanak Bosmia, Mr. R. Balaji, Mr. OVN Murthy and Mr. VGR Pavan, who have always encouraged me in my astrological pursuits.
The support and the encouraging words from Mrs. Shwetha Chary from USA are praisew rthy.
The encouragement from Dr. N.S. Pillai, a Homoeopathic Doctor and also an Astro researcher, is worth noting. I do acknowledge the guidance, confidence and encouragement instilled into me during the last two decades by my father-in-law, Mr. P. Narayanan Nair, who also had initiated me into the world of spiritualism and Occult Sciences.
Finally, I thank my elder brothers, MK Subhash Chandran, PK Chandran and PK Madhusudanan who have helped me in many ways in my life and my sisters, MK Shanta, PK Subhadra and MK Sujatha who always have special bonding, care and attention toward me. My wife P. Sreekala and my sons Vishnu V. Nair and Vinayak V. Nair have always supported and assisted me in my humble endeavours.
Considering myself always as a student; at the lotus feet of Uchishta Mahaganapthi and Gurujans.


Yours truly


MK VISWANATH

Stellar System in Astrology

The Stellar or nakshatra padhathi is based on an astrological practice, which advocates that a planet placed in a particular star will give the result of the star lord of that star.
For example, if Venus is placed in Jupiter's any of the stars such as Punarvasu or Visakha or Purva Bhadrapada, Venus will give the result of Jupiter. This applies to both in natal or in transit chart.
As regards the stars and their lords, please browse through the following table, which is traditionally called Navakam:

SI.
No.	Stars	Stars	Stars	Star lord
1	Aswini	Makha	Moola	Ketu
2	Bharani	Purva Phalguni	Purva Ashada	Venus
3	Kruthika	Uthara	Utharashada	Sun
4	Rohini	Hasta	Shravana	Moon
5	Mrigashira	Chitra	Dhanishta	Mars
6	Arudra	Swati	Satabhisha	Rahu
7	Punarvasu	Visakha	Purvabhadrapada	Jupiter
8	Pushya	Anuradha	Utharabhadrapad	Saturn
9	Aslesha	Jyeshta	Revathi	Mercury
In the above table, all the 27 stars have been illustrated. They have been divided into 9 divisions based upon the star lords. Stars Aswini, Makha and Moala are ruled by Ketu, while Bharani, Purva Phalunf and Purva Ashada are ruled by Venus. The sequence continues in this fashion as per the table above.
 
Basics of Nakshatra Padhathi (Marriage, Profession & Health)

Any planet posited in any of the stars of Venus will give the result of Venus. Same way, other stars shall be taken.
Now just see below horosoope chart for the native born on 27 Aug 1980 at 8-30 a.m., Hyderabad, India: (Chart No. 1)

Ra:	25 Cn 45- GK Ke:	25 Cp 45	HL:	22 LI 57	GL:	11 Aq ,45
From the charts above, the chart at left is South Indian chart, which should be counted clockwise, while the chart at the right side is North Indian diamond chart, which should be counted anti-clock wise.
It is seen from the above example chart that Jupiter is placed in the 12th house at 23 deg. 33 min. in Leo and is posited in the star Purvaa Phalguni. Purva Phalguni is ruled by Venus.
Here Jupiter is lord of Sagittarius and Pisces and hence bea:lmes lords of 04th and 07th house. Jupiter is posited in 12th house in Venus star. Hence Jupiter bea:lmes an agent of Venus. Venus is lord of 02, 09 and occupant of 10th house.
Hence Jupiter will give result of 04, 07, 12, lQ, 02, 09 houses. It is also seen that Mars is posited in Libra at 05 deg. 09 min.
in Chitra star ruled by Mars himself. When counted from Ase, Mars bea:lmes lord of 03 and 08 and occupant of 02nct house. Mars is in own star. Hence Mars wlll give the results of 03, 08, and 02nct houses.
 
Chapter 01: Stellar System in Astrology
Given below is a signification table for the above chart:

SL=Sign lord, PSSL=Planets posited in starofsign lord, OCC=Occupant, PSO=Planets posited in star of occupant, Asp=Aspect on house, Asp=Aspect on planet; Conj=Conjoined with.
Explaining the above table, 1st house (lagna) falls in Virgo. Hence Sign lord (SL) is Mercury. Stars ruled by Mercury are Aslesha, Jyeshta and Revati. Only Rahu is posited in Aslesha star. Hence Rahu is placed in column "PSSL" against first house. The occupant of 1st house is Saturn. Hence Saturn is placed in column "OCC" against first house. Stars ruled by Saturn are Pushya, Anurada and Uthara Bhadra. There are no planets in Saturn's stars. Hence column "PSO" is blank against first house. Same way, the signification chart has to be filled for other houses.
In other words, house-wise planetary signification is given below:

Significations of Nodes
There is no celestial body called Rahu and Ketu. In Astrology, they are called shadowy planets. The following diagram may be observed, which illustrate as to how Rahu and Ketu are defined:
Earth revolves around Sun. Moon, being a satellite of Earth, revolves around Earth. When the apparent paths of Earth and Moon touch, the Nodes are created.
The Nodes are Rahu and Ketu, who are considered North Node and South Node respectively will, function as agents of other planets.
The Nodes will give the result as stated below in the following order:
1)	Planets conjoined with.
2)	Planets aspected by.
3)	Lord of the star in which Nodes are posited.
4)	Finally, the result of the sign lord in which Nodes are posited.

Ketu (South Node)
In the reference chart under consideration, Ase is located in Aries. Hence the significations Ketu (South Node) shall be as follows:

Placement of Nakshtras in Rashi Chakra
The ancients have selected 27 important stars and they are spread in all the 12 signs of the zodiac, which are also called solar mansions. The longitude of each star is 13 deg. 20 min. each. Hence 13-20 x 27 = 360 deg. totally forms the entire zodiac.
The placement of all the 27 nakshatras and its padams (charan) are as per the chakra given below:

Revathi 1,2,3,4	Aswini 1,2,3,4	Kruthika 2,3,4	Mrigashira 3,4

One nakshatra is divided into 4 parts, which are called padams (charan). There are 12 Rashis in the Zodiac and one rashi each has got 9 nakshatra padams, i.e., 2 ¼ stars form one sign. It is seen from the above that Ashwini 1,2,3,4 padams, Bharani 1,2,3,4 padams and Kruthika 1 padam forms Aries (Mesham) = total 9 padams, which is 2 ¼ stars.
Kruthika 2,3,4 padams, Rohini 1,2,3,4 padams and Mrigashira 1,2 padams form (Taurus) Vrishabham = total 9 padams (2 ¼ stars). Mrigashira 3,4 padams, Arudra 1,2,3,4 and Punarvasu 1,2,3 padams form Gemini. Punarvasu 4th pada, Pushya 1,2,3,4 padams and Aslesha 1,2,3,4 padams form Cancer.
Stars in other Rashis may be continued similarly as per the chart given above.
The following table articulately states about the longitude of each nakshatra in the zodiac in degrees and minutes:

Although, there are twenty points which are to be checked when marriage compatibility is being checked; normally 1O important points are only verified.
The general points granted in South India are 36 points, especially in Andhra Pradesh, etc. In Muhurta Chintamani there are 36 points totally given. In places like Tamil Nadu there are total of 50 points allocated. In Kerala they take only 10 points for the total 1O kootas, and eliminated Nadi and Varna kootas. If 50% of the above marks are achieved, then it is found to be in agreement and Astrologer could give go-ahead signal as far as the stars are concerned.
In Ancient times, out of the 4 sections of the society such as Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vysya, and Shurdra importance given to the kootas for them as follows:-
 
Brahmins Kshatriya Vysya
 
Dina or tara is important. Ganam is important.
Rashi is important.
 
Shudra	Yoni is important. •
The Raliu is taken as very important for all the so-called castes and hence apart from the above important porutham, Raliu is also taken.
Note: The system of caste segregation is done away with in modern times, and is not being attached importance. In some parts of India, the consultants do give importantce to this.

Dina Ponthanam
Dina or tara means the star of the native. The astrologer needs to check if there is agreement between the stars of the boy and girl.
The procedure is that the astrologer should count from the star of the girl up to and including the star of the boy.
For example, if the star of the girl is Aswini and star of boy is Rohini, count from Aswini upto Rohini. The result is 4, in which case dina porutham is available.
If the boy's star falls beyond 9 stars from girl's star, (e.g, girl's star is Aswini and boy's star is Anuradha), in that case count from Aswini upto Anuradha, the result may be divided by 9. If the remainder is 4, 6, 9 or 2, 8, then accept it. If the remainder is 3, 5, or 7, then there is no dina porutham.
If the result is: 4, 6 or 9, then it is best. If the result is: 2, 8, it is middling. If the result is 3, Sor 7, then there is no dina ponthanam. This is because of:
Result No.	Tara name	Result	Remarks
1	Janma tara	Longevity of couple will be affected	Bad
2	Sampath tara	Wealth & Prosperity	Good for boy
3	Vipath tara	Accidents &
difficulties	Bad for girl, not matchable
4	Kshema tara	Prosperity	Good for girl
5	Prathyuk tara	Obstacles and impediments	Bad for boy, not matchable
6	Sadhana tara	Favourable	Good
7	Naidana tara	Sufferings and
hardships	Bad for girl
8	Mitra tara	Friendly	Good
If the boy's star happens to be the 3rd star from girl, reject if it is first pada and Astrologer can take 2, 3 and 4th padas.

Eka Nakshatra Porutham
The meaning of Ekanakshatra is one star. Suppose the star or janma nakshatra of the boy and girl is one, then it is called Eka Nakshatra.
Can eka nakshatra be matched?
Ancients advocate that Astrologers can match the following
Eka Nakshatras:
a)	Sun stars such as Kruthika, Uthara, and Uthara Ashada
b)	Mars Stars such as Mrigashira, Chitta (Chitra) and Dhanishta.
c)	Venus star Purva Ashada.
d)	Jupiter star Punarvasu.
e)	Moon star Hasta.
f)	Saturn star Anuradha.
g)	Mercury star Jyeshta.
The following eight Eka nakshatras are not specifically considered for matching:-
1)	Bharani, (2) Aslesha, (3) Swati, (4) Jyeshta, (5) Moola, (6)
Dhanishta, (7) Satabhisha (8) Purva Bhadra.
If the stars are same for both boy and girl, but if they are falling in different signs, the matching can be done. When counted from girl's star upto boy's star, if the pada is 88th one, then it is not suitable, since it is falling in 6 / 8 rashis.
In Eka Nakshatra porutham (alignment), the pada of the star of boy should be greater than that of girl's. But the ancients also say that the rest of the stars are not considered for Eka Nakshatra porutham. If the pada and star of both boy and girl are same, then matching cannot be done.
However, there are different opinions among authors with regard to eka nakshatra porutham.
 

Some consider the transit of Saturn over natal Moon as very important and during this period of 7½ years natives face some unknown problems.
When transit Saturn reaches the 12th sign from natal Moon (Janma rashi), the saade saath commences and it will be continued for 7½ years until Saturn reaches 03rd house from Moon.
Hence some Astrologers do not consider matching between boy and girl of same star or same rashi.
Gana Ponthanam
There are three gana such as Deva gana, Manushya gana and Rakshasa (Asura) gana.
1.	Deva Gana
Persons with Deva gana are supposed to be well behaved, affectionate, soft and good natured with good character and high values.
2.	Manusha Gana
Persons of manushya gana shall be said to have all the good and bad qualities of humans. Their behaviour is good but they also tend to show their anger, enmity at times.
3.	Rakshas Ganam
Persons of Rakshsa gana shall be said to have behavior, nature, and character to be aggressive, rude and rough.
It is difficult for them to co-operate with others. They can upset others by their unpleasant behavior and talk. Many times they will think they are right and others are wrong. But they are also good sometimes.
Stars are classified into three different ganas. The gana of the boy and girl should be same. But in some cases, this is not achieved.
The Ganas allocatecYto each star is given in the tabular form in the beginning. However, for the convenience of the readers, it is repeated below:-
 

 

1	Dev Gana	Aswini, Mrugashira, Punarvasu, Pushya, Hastha, Swati, Anurada, Sravana,
Revati	Total 9 stars
2	Manushya Gana	Bharani, Rohini, Arudra,
Purvaphalguni, Utharaphalguni, PuNashada, Utharashada, Purvabhadra,
Utharabhadra	Total 9 stars
3	Asura or Rakshasa Gana	Krithika, Aslesha, Makha, Chitra, Visakha, Jyeshta, Moala, Dhanishta,
Satabshisha.	Total 9 stars
Hence if both are Deva or Manushya Gana they agree for an alignment. In case the gana of the girl is Deva and that of the boy is Manushya it agrees as secondary. If both are of Rakshasa they do not agree. This agreement confers general happiness of marital life.
If the stars are beyond 14, then Rakshasa and Manushya can be matched. Matching between Deva gana and Rakshasa gana, is not at all good.
 

Rashi Ponthanam
The sign occupied by Moon is called Janma Rashi or Moon sign. The alignment between the Moon's position between the ooy and girl is a mandatory point, which is called Rashi Porutham.
The procedure is that counting is to be done from the girl's Moon sign upto and including the boy's Moon sign, and if the result is:
2)	- It is death and cannot be matched.
3)	- It is misery and sorrow.
4)	- It is poverty.
5)	- It is widowhood.
6)	- It is loss of children.
7)	- It is prosperity and long life.
8)	- It is many a children.
9)	- It provides immunity from widowhood.
10)	- It is wealth.
11)	- It is happiness.
12)	- It is long life.
The best position is 7 / 7, which is called Samasapthama, i.e., from Aries to Libra or from Aquarius to Leo, etc.
6 I 8 is called Shashtashtakam i.e., when counted from the girl's janma rashi upto boy's janma rashi, if it is 6, then when counted from boy's to that of girl's rashi, then it is 8. For example, from Taurus to Libra is 6th sign and from Libra to Taurus is 8th sign.
The general concept is that 6 / 8 should not be matched. But in practical there are no problems if 6 / 8 rashis are matched.
Graha Maitri Ponthanam
As far as the graham maitri is concerned, it is nothing but the relationship between the planets. The relationship such as friends, neutrals, enemies etc. are given via table below:-
 

Planet	Friend	Neutral	Enemy
Sun	Mars, Jupiter, Moon	Mercury	Venus, Saturn
Moon	Mercury, Jupiter, Sun	Mars, Venus, Saturn	None
Mars	Sun, Moon, Jupiter, Venus	Saturn	Mercury
Mercury	Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
Venus	-	Moon
Jupiter	Sun, Moon, Mars, Saturn	-	Venus, Mercury
Venus	Mercury, Saturn	Mars, Jupiter	Sun, Moon
Saturn	Mercury, Venus	Mars, Jupiter	Sun, Moon
From the above, you will observe that no planet treats both Jupiter and Mars as enemy.
Hooever, it is felt that there are lesser significations for the above aspect in a natal chart, while applying Stellar System, since the planet will more predominantly give the result of the star lord of the star in which it is posited.
Stree Dirgham
Many people mistake this particular point "Stree Dirgham" as the longevity of the spouse.
Stree dirgham is nothing but, the distance of stars by number from that of girl to that of boy.
Ancients proclaim that sthree dirgham shall be good, if the star of boy from the star of the girl is beyond 13 stars. In such cases it is treated as having sthree dirgha. Let us see an example: The girl's chart (No.3) is given below:
 
















As:	24 Ge 59	Su:	10 Li 57- BK	Mo:	4 Ge18- GK	Ma:	17 Sc 39-AmK
Me (R):	24 Li 54-AA	Ju:	6 Vi 35- PK	Ve:	3 Vi 15- DK	Sa:	10 Vi 54- MK
Ra:	22Cn2S:PiK	Ke:	22Cp29	HL:	23Aq06	GL:	12Pi21
The girl is born on 27 Oct 1980 at 22-42 hours at Hyderabad, India. She is born on Mrigashira star 3rd pada in Gemini.
The boy's chart No.4 is as follows:




 






In the chart of the boy, born on 12 Aug 1976 at 12-52 pm Near Kottayam, Kerala, star is Purva Bhadrapada 02nd pada in Aquarius sign.
Now, in order to find the sthree dirgha, students may count from Mrigashira upto Purva Bhadrapada. It is 21st star. Hence the star of the boy is beyond 13, the Stree Dirgha point is achieved.
 

Mahendram
In Astrology, Kendra means quadrants, which are the houses 1, 4, 7, and 10. Mahendram means maha kendram. Maha means great.
Counting is from the girl's star upto and including boy's star. If the boy comes as 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 22, 26 they agree for Mahendram porutham.
For example, if the girl' star is Rohini and boy's star is Uthara, count from Rohini upto and including Uthara. Uthara shall be the 9th star from Rohini. Hence in this case Mahendra Porutham is not achieved.
Suppose the girl's star is Mrigashira and the boy's star is Makha, count from Mrigashira upto and including Makha. The result is 7, which has achieved Mahendram.
It is advocated by Ancients that Mahendra porutham confers wealth and children for the couple.
Graha Maitri
The Jama Rasi or Moon sign for both the girl and boy should be agreeing to each other. This confers mutual affection between couples.
 
Rasi Aries Taurus Gemini Cancer Leo Virgo Libra Scorpio
Sagittarius Capricorn Aquarius Pisces
 
Agreeable Rasis Scorpio, Leo Cancer
Virgo
Sagittarius, Scoprio Libra
Gemini, Pisces Capricorn, Virgo Cancer
Pisces Pisces Virgo
Aries
 

If the girl's janma rashi is Cancer, agreeable boy's chart for Graha Maitri are Sagittarius and Scorpio.
Vedha
Vedha means affliction. This koota agreement wards off all evils and pit-falls in marital life. A happy and prosperous married life is assured.
Certain stars are mutually anti or opposite to each other. The star of boy and girl should not be mutually anti to each other. They are as follow:
Aswini	





Vedha to	Jvehsta
Bharani		Anuradha
Kritika		Visakha
Rohini		Swati •
Ardra		Sravana
Punarvasu		Uttarashadha
Pushya		Poorvashadha
Aslesha		Moala
Magha		Revati
Poorvaphalguni		Uttara bhadra oada
Hasta		Satabisha
Uttaraphalguni		Poorvabhadrapada
From the remaining stars, Mrugashira, Chitra and Dhanishta are mutually vedha to each other. This vedha agreement is very important like Ra]u agreement. Happiness cannot be obtained if they are in Vedha.
Exception: If guru balam is available for star or star lord, then it can be matched.
Rajju
All the 27 stars have been classified into 5 types of Rauu_.
Ra]u bestows on the girl living happily with the husband for the long time. It is considered as the most important of the ten
 

koatas as it ensures a long life for the husband. The table below shows the different Raiius allocated to the stars:
Rajju	Stars
Siro (Head)	Mirgasira, Chitra, Dhanishta
Kanta (Neck)	Rohini, Arudra, Hasta, Swati, Sravana, Satabisha
Nabhi (Middle)	Krithika,	Punarvasu,	Uttara,	Visaka, Uthrashada, Purvabadra
Ooru (Thigh)	Sarani, Pushya, Pubba, Anuradha, Uttarabadra, Purvashada
Paa::la (Foot)	Aswani, Aslesha, Maka, Jyeshta, Moala, Revati
Another method of seeing the Raiiu allocated to each star is as follows:-
	Mrigashira Chitta, Dhanista	Siro Rajju		





Arohana Raiiu Stars	Rohini Hasta Shravana	Kanta Rajju	Arudra Swati Satabhisha	




Avarohana Raiiu Stars
	Kruthika Uthara U.Ashada	Nabhi Rajju	Punarvasu Visakha
P. Bhadra	
	Bharani
Pubba P.Ashada	Ooru Rajju	Pushya Anuradha
U. Bhadra	
	Aswini Makha Moala	Paada Rajju	Aslesha
Jyeshta Revathi	
From Aswini to Rohini they are arohana Raiius and from Arudra to Aslesha, they are Avarohana Rauus. For example Kruthika is Arohana Nabhi Raiiu while Punarvasu is Avarohana Nabhi Raiiu. For other stars the diagram will be similar from Makha to Jyeshta and from Moala to Revathi. All the Mars owned stars such as Mrigashira, Chitta and Dhanishta are always Siro Rauu only, and they are not classified either as Arohana or Avarohana.
 

If both the stars of the boy and girl fall in the same portion as foot or head or neck etc. there is no agreement (Rajjus of the boy and girl should be different from each other). If they happen to be in the same line as head, the husband will die, if in the neck, the wife will meet with death, if in the middle loss of children, if under thigh extreme poverty and if under foot pitiable wanderings. This is a very important agreement.
Yoni Porutham
The yoni allocated to each star is given above in the beginning. If the yoni of the boy and girl is same, then it can be matched. Bhinna or different yoni is also could be matched.
The table of stars and their yoni are given below:
Stars No.	Star	Star lord	Yoni
A	B	C	D
Ashwini	1	Ketu	Horse (M)
Bharani	2	Venus	Elephant(M)
Kruthika	3	Sun	Goat (F)
Rohini	4	Moon	Snake (M)
Mrugashir	5	Mars	Snake (F)
Arudra	6	Rahu	Dog (M)
Punarvasu	7	Jupiter	Cat (F)
Pushyami	8	Saturn	Goat (M)
Aslesha	9	Mercury	Cat (M)
Makha	1	Ketu	Rat (M)
Pubba	2	Venus	Rat (F)
Uthara	3	Sun	Bull (M)
Hasta	4	Moon	Buffallo(M)
Chitra	5	Mars	Tiger (M)
Swati	6	Rahu	Deer (F)
Visakha	7	Jupiter	Tiger (F)
Anuradha	8	Saturn	Deer (F)
 

Jyeshta	9	Mercury	Deer (M)
Moola	1	Ketu	Dog (M)
Purva Ashada	2	Venus	Monkey (F)
Uthara Ashada	3	Sun	Mongoose (F)
Shravana	4	Moon	Monkey (F)
Dhanishta	5	Mars	Lion (F)
Satabisha	6	Rahu	Horse (F)
Purva Bhadra	7	Jupiter	Lion (M)
Uthara Bhadra	8	Saturn	Cow (F)
Revathi	9	Mercury	Elephant(F)
Note: M=Male yoni, F=Female yoni.
No matching is allowed between Shatru or enemy yoni. For example:-	Snake	Enemy of	Horse
 
Tiger Cat
Mongoose
 
Enemy of Enemy of Enemy of
 
Deer Rat Snake
 
In these cases the yoni porutham is not available.
Nadi Porutham
Nadi, which means pulse, is classified with reference to the 27 stars into 3 types such as Aadhi nadi, Madhyama Nadi and Anthya nadi.
The nadi allocated to each star is given above in the tablular form in the beginning. For convenience of the readers the nadi allocated to each star is once aaain aiven below·- .
 


Hastha	Chithra	Swath i
Jyeshta
Macia	Anuradha
Purva Ashada	Visakha
Utharashada
Satabhisha	Dhanishta	Shravana
Purva Bhadrapada	Utharabhadrpada	Revati
If the star of both boy and girl falls in different Nadi, then there is nadi porutham. For Example: Aswini star is Aadhi nadi whereas Rohini is Anthya nadi. Hence Nadi porutham is achieved between the stars Aswini and Rohini.
Vashya
The table below shows the Rashis and the vashya rashis:-
SI.
No.	Janma Rashi	Janma
Vashya Rashi	SI.
No.	Janma Rashi	Janma Vashya Rashi
1	Aries	Leo, Scorpio	07	Libra	Capricorn, Virgo
2	Taurus	Cancer, Leo	08	Scorpio	Cancer
3	Gemini	Virgo	09	Sagittarius	Pisces
4	Cancer	Scorpio, Sagittarius	10	Capricorn	Aquarius, Aries
5	Leo	Libra	11	Aquarius	Aries
6	Virgo	Pisces, Geminl	12	Pisces	Capricorn
For example, for a person born in Mesha (Aries} rashi, the vashya rashi are Leo and Scorpio.
Similarly, for a person born in Leo sign (Simha), Libra shall be the vashya rashi.
 
Vadha Vainashika Dosha

Vadha Vainashika dosha is considered in some parts of India only. When counted from girl's star upto and including boy's star, if the result is 7, then it ls said to have vadha vainashika dosha. For example, if the girls star is Anurada and if the boy's star is Dhanishta, count from Anuradha upto and including Dhanishta. The result is
7. When counted in reverse order i.e., from Dhanishta upto Anuradha the result is 22, which is said to have Vadha Vainashika dosha. l-lence 07 / 22 stars alignment is acceptable.
Readers may see the chart below which are having 7 / 2 2 result and confirms vadha vainashika dosha:-

Dasha Sandhi

Dasha sandhi indicates end of a particular planetary operating period and beginning of a new operating period at one point of time in one's life.
If such a situation takes effect both for husband and wife, then it is called dasha sandhi.
Astrolgers generally see the malefic planets' dasha sandhi such as Saturn, Mars, Rahu and Ketu.
The concept of considering dasha sandhi to cause death to either of the couple cannot be considered as a reality.
If malefic planets have got connection to ardha houses and punya houses, one shall not have any problem during dasha sandhi. However, it is seen dasha sandhi happens from a benefic planet to a malefic planet and at that time if saade saath period operates, one undergoes various problems in life.
This particular method is seen mostly in some parts of South India.

Porutham or Stars Alignment
 


The matching has achieved 06 / 10 points as per the Kerala system, while 29 I 40, 36 I 50, 26I 36 points as per other systems.
But the couples have been at logger-heads right from the beginning of marriage, though they are living together as of July 2010 i.e., after 06 years of marriage. They are blessed with a daughter too.
The main reasons for the marital discord have been identified are as follow:
Girl's Chart
Moon is posited in the lagna and aspected 07th house. Moon is in the star of Mars, who is lord of 06 as well as occupant of 06th house.
Boy's Chart
Venus is lord of 07th and is posited in Ketu star Makha in 10th house. Ketu, in turn, is posited in Venus star Bharani in 06th house. During Mercury (in Venus star PuNa) dasha and Ketu bhukti, the couple had lot of difficulties between them including temporary separation.
Vairaghya or enimity is brought about by Saturn, who aspects Ketu. Moon in 4th house, gets the aspect of Mars, who signifies 06th house, will cause mental conflict and aggressiveness. From Moon sign, Ketu being placed in Venus star in 03rd house will also signify 3 and 4, making the person moody. Lord of 11 (Mercury) and lord of 12 (Venus) are conjoined, making the person not having control over spending, which also caused rift in marital life.
Since, Jupiter, lord of 02 and 05 (romance, love, etc.) is posited in 07th house, it is felt that boy will not be able to get a divorce.

Sahams or Sensitive Points

Sahams are sensitive point propounded by Sage Parashara. There are many sahams. In the question of marriage and child birth, one could see vivaha saham and putra saham.
Let us check the sahams in the following chart no.07.

Vivaha Saham (One rule for day or night birth)
Longitude of Venus minus longitude of Sun plus longitude of Lagna.

The saham corresponds with Leo at 25 deg 49 min., which is in Venus star Purva.
The marriage of the native took place on 11 Apr 1988 when the transit Jupiter (vivaha karaka) was in Jupiter star Bharani, corresponding to o?'h house of the native. Since Venus signifies 01,08,10,04,05 the marriage saham is average, but not detrimental.
Putra Saham (For Male or Female)
Putra saham or a sensitive point in a horoscope chart generally considered for progeny is formed by a mathematical calculation,
Day Birth
Longitude of Jupiter minus Longitude of Mercury + longitude of Lagna.
		SS-DD-MM
	Longitude of Jupiter	09-04-50
Minus	Lonaitude of Mercury	05-02-20
	Sub total	04-02-30
Plus	Longitude of Ase.	06-01-12
	Putra saham	10-03-42
The putra saham falls in 10th sign, 03 deg and 42 min, which means, it falls in Aquarius sign at 03 deg 42 minutes corresponding to Dhanishta star ruled by Mars. Mars signifies 02, 07, 12, 10, 08 houses. 12th will signify loss and 08th will signify impediments. 10th will negate 11th house. But houses 02 (addition of a member) and o?'h (second issue) are favourable houses. Hence although there was initial disappoint with reference to progeny in this case, ultimately favourable houses helped the matter.
Night Birth
Long. of Mercury minus Long. of Jupiter plus Long. of Ase.

Bija Sputa
In order to assess the fertility aspect of the boy, Bija Sputa is calculated. The Bija Sputa is a sensitive point in the horoscope, which is arrived at by adding up the longitude of Jupiter, Sun and Venus.
It is not desirable for the Bija sputa to fall in 06, 08 or 12
houses when counted from Ascendant.

The Bija sputa longitude falls in 05 signs, 02 deg. and 03 min. This falls in Virgo at Sun star Uthara. Sun is posited in 11th house, although Bija sputa fall in 1ih house from lagna, its signification of 11th house (Sun) is considered as good.
 

Kshetra Sputa
In order to assess the fertility aspect of the girl, kshetra Sputa is calculated. The kshetra Sputa is a sensitive point in the horoscope, which is arrived at by adding up the longitude of Jupiter, Mars and Moon.
For Kshetra sputa, take the following chart no. 08 of a female, who is born on23 Dec 1966 at 7-00 am IST, Vaikom, Kottayam, Kerala:

Note: Sperm Count And Some Remedies To Increase
It
A low sperm count (oligospermia) is one cause for male
infertility. Although it takes only a single sperm to fertilize an egg (ovum), the odds of a single sperm reaching an egg are very low.
Normal sperm count is 20 million or more per milliliter of semen. In order to father a child 60% of those sperms should have normal shape, including standard forward movement (motility)
Some of the reasons for lack of sperm count is given below:-
1.	Infected semen, tight underpants, bathing in very hot water, sitting for long hours, over weight in which fat layers sag on testicles reduce sperm count
2.	Very frequent semen ejaculation also lead to lowered sperm count and man may become effectively infertile. Hence maintaining a gap of 3 days between two consecutive ejaculations keeps a man more fertile.
3.	Smoking, excessive alcohol intake, Over exertion physically and mentally, zinc deficiency, Infections present in prostate gland, mal-formed genital organs, Anabolic steroid use.
Following are some of the points to be taken care to increase semen count:-
1.	Have sex & masturbate less often - the more times you ejaculate, the less dense your semen will be. Maintain a gap of 3 days between two consecutive ejaculations.
2.	Refrain from habits like smoking, alcohol consumption, etc. Alcohol affects your liver function, which in turn, causes a dramatic rise in estrogen levels. Even two drinks a day will have long-term effects on sperm production
3.	Exercise regularly. Exercising your PC muscle can help you shoot further than ever before.
4.	Eat Nutritious Food - Diet that's low in fat, and high in protein, vegetables, and whole grains is good for your health and for your sperm. Avoid bitter, astringent and spicy foods. Reduce caffeine intake.
 

5.	Avoid heating of testicles - Wear loose, cotton boxer shorts, Avoid hot baths and saunas
6.	Lose any excess weight, which tends to cause testosterone I
oestrogen imbalances
7.	Reduce stress levels by learning relaxation techniques - Keep your mind and body healthy by regular practice of YffiA. and MEDITATION.
8.	Try supplements - Certain natural supplements promise to increase sperm production.
9.	Make love in the early morning or afternoon. Sperm levels are often highest in the mornings.

The betrothal took place on 21-Jun-2009 during Sun-Mar-Sat. The betrothal is an agreement between the boy's and girl's parties. Since the agreement is connected to marriage, take ih house. Agreement is seen from 3rd house. Hence take 3rd house. ?th from 3rd signifying opposite party is 9th. Also 9th becomes 3rd from ih
house, signifying 3rd house of opposite party.
Sun signifies J'h house. Mars is lord of 3rd house. Saturn is posited in 9th house. Hence engagement took place in Sun dasha, Mars bhukti and Saturn antara.
For marriage take 02, 07, and 11 houses. The marriage took place on 30-Aug-2009 at 10-00 a.m. Marriage took place during
 


Sun-Mar-Sun period. Sun is lord of '71h house. Mars is posited in Sun star Uthara ashdada. Hence Mars signifies 07* house. Hence the marriage took place during Sun-Mar-Sun period, under the transit chart given below:

Kuja (Sevai) Dosha or Manglik

Mars is a planet of logic, violence, aggression, quarrels and accidents, and is termed as the celestial executioner by astrologers. Hence Astrologers from ancient times do attach much prominence to the Kuja dosha (evil effect of Mars) while evaluating the horoscope for marriage matching.
If Mars or Kuja happens to be placed in 1, 2, 4, 7, 8 or 12th houses when counted from Ascendant, Moon or Venus, then the native is said to have Kuja Dosha. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Kuja dosha is being given more weightage in places like Kerala and matches are not cleared unless the balancing placement is found in both the horoscope charts of boy and girl.

 


   
The charts illustrated above with Kuja dosha (evil effect of Mars) may be perused.
1)	In Chart 5 above, Mars is placed in 4th house from Ase, while in 2nd from Moon and Venus.
2)	In Chart 6 Mars is placed in ?'h house from Ase.
3)	In Chart 7 Mars is placed in 1ih house from Ase.
4)	In Chart 8 Mars is placed in 8th house from Ase.
These combinations are treated as having Kuja Dosha or Manglik.
The exceptions to Kuja dosha given are:
a)	When Mars is yogakaraka (for Cancer and Leo born people).
b)	When Mars is posited in its own house (Aries or Scorpio).
c)	When Mars is posited in the sign of its friends like Sun and Jupiter, which means Mars when posited in Leo, Sagittarius or Pisces, there is no kuja dosha.
d)	Some Astrologers also opine that when Mars is posited in moveable signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, or Capricorn), there is no Kuja dosha.
e)	If lagna falls in the houses of Venus.
This rule should be applicable, if Moon or Venus are placed either in Cancer or Leo, since Kuja dosha is counted not only from Ase, but also from Moon and Venus.
 


If Venus is in 1ih house to Mars, there is no Kuja dosha. If Venus is very strong like Uccha, Moolatrikona, there is no Kuja dosha. If Venus or Jupiter or a benefic is placed in 1O * house, then there is said to be having no kuja dosha.
The combinations for Kuja dosha, as per Vedic Astrology, are illustrated in few examples below:-
In the example no. 8 above, Ase is posited in Libra while Mars is posited in 12* house. According to Vedic Astrology, this contributes to Kuja dosha.
In the example no. 9 above, Ase is in Capricorn and Mars is posited in Aries in own house (in 4th house). Hence this does not contribute to Kuja dosha.

 

In the example No. 18 above, PS£ is Cancer while Mars is posited in ih house in Capricorn. Mars is exalted in Capricorn. l-lence it amounts to no Kuja dosha.
This chart is similar to that of Lord Shri Ram of Ramayana fame. But he had problem in marital life such as Sita was abducted by Ravana of Lanka and later Lord Ram himself abdicated her. Is It because of Kuja dosha? Some Astrologers claim so. But in effect, It is not because of Kuja dosha that his wife was abducted and later given up by him. Other combinations also are required to be seen in the chart for divorce or separation. Mars dosha does not alone contribute for separation in marital life.
The subject of abduction or restriction of movements is dealt separately in later chapters.
In the example chart no. 19 above, PS£ is in Libra and Mars is posited in Virgo being 12th house and is in 2nd house from Venus. As per Vedic Astrology, this is termed as Manglik or having Kuja dosha.
In the example chart no. 20 above, PS£ is not specified. Mars is posited in 12* from Venus, but is exalted in Capricorn. Hence there is no Kuja dosha as per Vedic astrology.
In the example chart no. 21 above, P-s= is in Libra. Mars is posited in 2nd from Lagna, but is in own house in Scorpio. Hence there is no Kuja dosha as per Vedic astrology.
 


   
In the example chart no. 22 above, Asc is not specified. Mars is posited in 4th from Venus, in Taurus, which is a fixed sign. Hence this amounts to Kuja dosha as per Vedic astrology.
In the example chart no. 23 above, Moon is in Libra. Mars is posited in 7th from Moon, in Aries, which is own sign. Hence this amounts to no Kuja dosha as per Vedic astrology.
But the Astrologer has to see in practical as to what is the lagna in cases like this. Lagna is always stronger than Moon sign or Venus sign.

In the example chart no. 24 above, Ase is in libra. Mars is posited in 8th from Lagna in Taurus, which is a fixed sign. Hence this amounts to Kuja dosha as per Vedic astrology.
But Mars being lord of 07, posited in 08th house will contribute some impediments in marital life since 08th house stands for
 

impediments, disappointments, etc. When Mars is posited in 08th house, Jt aspects 02nd house (speech). In this case Mars becomes lord of 02nd house also. When Mars is posited in 08th house, the
person speaks logically and harshly and argues well, besides sadistic to a certain extent, because of the characteristics of Mars.
In the example chart no. 25 above, M£ is in Pisces. Mars is posited in 2nd house from L.agna in Aries, which is own house. Henoo this amounts to no Kuja dosha as per astrology.
It is concluded that just because of Mars is posited in 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, or 12 either from L.agna or Moon or Venus does not contribute to Kuja dosha, irrespective of Mars's position in its places of exemption allowed.
Astrologers say Mars is a Killer.

The native's husband died on 20-Dec-2001 during Rahu-Venus-Sun-Mars period. Death is seen from Bhadaka, Maraka, and Mokashakaraka planets during their periods.
Maraca will be 02 and 07 houses while Badhaka is 11, 09, 07 for Moveable, FD<ed and dual signs respectively. Moksha is always seen from 12* house. Astrologers need to consider all the planets signifying these houses into consideration such as (a) Lord (b) planets posited in the stars of lord (c) Occupant (d) Planets posited in the star of occupants. (e) Take Nodes (Rahu and Ketu) significations also.
If the chart promises longevity, even if there is Kuja dosha, the person will live long.
As per Stellar System, if a planet posited in "X" star, will also give the result of that star lord. For example, if Venus is posited in any of stars such as Punarvasu, Visakha or Purva Bhadra ruled by Jupiter, Venus will give result of Jupiter also. Same way, one could take for other stars and planets.
The longevity of spouse should be reckoned by rotating the chart 7th house. 07th lord is Mars, who is in Aries in Venus star Bharani. Hence Mars will give Venus results. Bhadhaka for Aries (Moveable sign) is Saturn. Maraka for Aries is 2nd and 7th lords, which in this case is Venus. Mars is in Venus star and will give result of Venus. Planets posited in 2nd house from Aries are Saturn and Moon, both of whom are in Sun star. Sun is Badhaka being occupant of 11 * house.
Sun is in Rahu star and will signify Rahu. Rahu is in Moon star and will also sigoify Saturn. Both Saturn and Moon are Maraca. Mars (signifying lagna lord for husband) is in between Maraka planets and also signifies Maraka and Moksha. Because of these combinations Husband's longevity is only medium. Hence the period of Rahu-Venus-Sun-Mars really tantamount for the significations connected for death of husband.
Although Mars is posited in 07* house, since it is in own house, there is no Kuja dosha. But many students get doubt raised in their mind as to whether really Kuja dosha exists or not, since Mars is posited in 7* house.
 


The explanation glven in the previous paragraphs about early death of husband is sufficient enough to say that it is not due to Kujadosha.
Following chart no. 27 belong to a married couple:
Female was born on 23-Dec-1966 at 7-00 a.m. near Cochin, Kerala.

In the chart above of a female, Mars is posited in the 10* house from lagna and Venus, while it is in 06* from Moon. Hence there is no Kuja dosha.

In the chart of husband mentioned above, rv1ars is posited in 12* from Lagna in Virgo indicating Kuja dosha for him, whereas wife is not having Kuja dosha. But the couples are happily living together for the past two decades.
Chart No.29 below appended belongs to Ms. Jacqueline Kennedy, wife of former US President John F Kennedy.

For evaluating the aspect of spouse, astrologers need to rotate the chart to 07* house, which means take 07* house as lagna.
President Kennedy was shot dead on 23-Nov-1963 during Jacqueline's Moon-Jup-Sat period. Moon is posited in 12* for husband (07* house), becomes moksha. Jupiter is posited in l\tloon star and hence signifies 12* house--moksha. Saturn is badhaka for Taurus.
 













Jacqueline Kennedy
 
Lord of 07th (for husband) Venus becomes lagna lord. Venus is posited in Mars star Mrigashira. Mars is lord of 07 and 12 - maraka and moksha respectively. Hence lagna lord Venus become significator of Maraca and moksha.
In this case Mars has got killing powers due to maraca and moksha lordship. But the dasha / Bhukti / Antara lords were not connected to Mars.
 

 

Unless Mars has got connection to lagna, 06* and 08* houses, injury through accident cannot be caused. In such a situation, if the dasha / bhukti / antara running at that time have got connection to maraca, badhaka or moksha, then it will be a serious matter of life threatening.
In this case referred above, Mars is posited in Venus star Purva. Herre Mars become a significator of 01 (self), 06 (Injury). Jupiter (08-accident) is posited in Moon star, but is in lagna and is conjoined with lagna lord Venus, who is posited in Mars star, Mrigashira.
From the 07* house, significations of planets are:

Jupiter, Rahu and Saturn

Rahu Connection
In northern side of India and in Kerala it is said that they give importance to Rahu / Ketu Dasha. Rahu / Ketu affliction is treated as having V2 dosha in some parts of South India.
Rahu / Ketu axis in Ase, 2nd house, 4* house are to be viewed carefully. When Rahu is in Ase, Ketu will be in 7* house or vice versa. If Rahu is in 2nd house, Ketu will be in 8* or vice versa.
A::£ and 7* signifies se  and spouse respectively while 2nd is family and 8* is family of spouse. 4* is home environment.
Equal balancing of Rahu / Ketu is required for the above combinations in both the charts of boy and girl.
If Rahu or Ketu is conjoined Ase, 2nd, 4*, 7*, 8* lords then also the above rule is applicable.
But in effect there is no such dosha is found. The roles of Nodes have to be taken as per the significations of them explained in in previous paragraph.
Saturn Connection
If Saturn is connected with Moon, it is said there will be disappointments in marital alignments, fixation or during celebrations.
If Saturn is connected with 7* house or 7* lord by aspect or conjunction or otherwise, the marriage is likely to be delayed. In that case Saturn only will give the marriage during its dasha or bhukti or antara periods and when transits agree.
 
In the chart (No.30) mentioned below, 07* lord is Jupiter, who is conjoined with Saturn.


The marriage took place in Jupiter dasha, Saturn bhukti, Rahu antara on 09 May 2004 in her 24* year. Marriage did not take place in Jup-Jup due to conjunction of Saturn with Jupiter. Hence Saturn gave marriage in its bhukti.
Jupiter Strength
Jupiter's strength is considered as quite important in a chart, especially for female charts when it comes for marriage. Jupiter signifies vivaha karaka, putra karaka and even considered as husband. If Jupiter is lacking strength or placed in papa kartari yoga, or in adverse house, care may be taken to analyze this particular aspect.
According to ancients, if a well-placed Vivaha karaka Jupiter is having connection with martial houses or lord, then the affliction level is supposed to be minimized.
However, in the female chart No. 31 illustrated below, if Jupiter is placed in 7* house when counted from Lagna, then she will get a husband who could be a person who either suspects her or discouraging her.

Readers may go through the chart of female nativity illustrated above, in which Jupiter is placed in the 7* house from Ase. The native is found it very difficult to push along with the marital life, because of the unsteady behaviour of her husband. In this case, lord of 07, Moon has got placed in the 06* house, which is a negating house to 07* house. This point, of course, has also to be considered.

In the chart erected above too, the native, female, had to encounter untold miseries from the husband, such as separation, litigation, etc., but did not divorce.
Hence care is required to be taken while evaluating the chart of the female too.
 
7th	Lord With 06 / 08 /1 2 Connection

07* lord bestows marriage. Take supporting houses like 02 and 11 for addition of a member and long time relationship, respectively.
06*, 08* or 12* houses are classified as Dush sthanas or bad houses.
06* house signifies among many, separation from spouse, diseases, ill-health, borrowing, loans, etc.
08* house stands for sudden accidents, deaths, impediments, difficulties, etc., while 12* house is for loss, expenses, hospitals, new environments, charity, spirituality, etc.
The connection of 07* lord or a planet signifying 07* house with that of planets connected with 06 / 08 / 12 are not desirable for smooth martial llfe.
In the chart no. 33 mentioned below, 07thJord is Mars, who is posited in 12* house. Mars is in the star of Moon who signifies 08 and 10.

Re:	3 Le 11-AK	 e:	3.A.q 11	HL:	15 Sc 30	GL:	29PI 36
Mars is aspected by Jupiter, who is lord of 06* house. Hence 07* has got connection to 06 (aspect of Jupiter), 08, 12 houses. This is quite detrimental for smooth martial affairs.
 
Venus Position and Ketu Connection
Venus is the Chief Governor of marriage. Venus signifies women, wife, pleasures, drinks, enjoyments, cushions, comforts, creativity, beauty, etc.
Ketu is the mokshakaraka and stands for emancipation, non-materialiastic, spiritual thinking, etc.
When Venus and Ketu are conjoined or connected to O7* house, it is felt that there is not much love and affection between a married couple.
An example chart no. 34 is given below:

As:	1 Sc 42	Su:	26 Cn 16- AmK Mo:	23Aq 32-BK	Ma:	28Le59-AK

The chart, belonging to a male, has got Scorpio rising with Venus being lord of O7* house. Venus is posited in Ketu star Makha in Leo and thus will give result of Ketu. Ketu in turn, is posited Venus Bharani star in Aries. Bharani is ruled by Venus.
The native is not able to adjust in marital life and complains of lack of response and romance from spouse.
 
Longevity
What is foremost and important to be evaluated is the longevity aspect in the chart of both l:x:ly and girl. Elders say Ayurarogya sowkhyam, meaning good longevity and health.
If the chart does not promise longevity, Astrologer should fore-warn the client about it, and should decline to match the chart for marriage.
The longevity is seen from lagna (for self) and 8* house. 8* from 8* house is 3rd house, which also is counted for longevity as per bhavat bhavam.
According to Vedic point of view, 8* house of the girl is also seen for the longevity of marital life. If the 8* house and 8* lord are heavily afflicted, then the longevity of the husband will be in trouble. If there is no longevity for either of the native, the matching should not be done.
The significators of maraca or badhaka houses when connected to houses of longevity, they shall always threaten the longevity of a native.
Longevity is classified into 4 categories viz. Balarishta, Alpayu, Madhya Ayu and Puma Ayu. Some Astrologers consider Aparimitha ayu also, which means unlimited longevity.
Longevity of Balarishtta cases are upto 08 years viz:.
a)	Alpa Ayu is upto 33 years.
b)	Madhya ayu will indicate upto 33 to 66 years.
c)	Purna Ayu is upto 100 years.
d)	Aparimitha ayu is beyond 100 years.
 

a)	When it comes to longevity, houses to be checked are dush-sthana, maraca, badhaka, moksha, which negate longevity.
b)	06, 08, 12 houses are dush sthana.
c)	12* house stands for moksha also.
d)	Punya houses are 01, OS, 09, while 1O* house stands for kam1a, which stand for good longevity.
e)	Consider Saturn as Ayushkaraka and yogakaraka planet for showering beneficial rays.
f)	Planets posited in own star or own house or exalted become stronger on given situations.
Badhaka
Forall Chara (moveable) signs, 11 * house shall be the badhaka. For all Sthira (fixed) signs, 09* house, and for all Dwiswabha (dual) 07* house shall be badhaka.
The badhaka table is given below:

The lagna lord and 08* lord is Mars, who signifies O1, 08 and occupying in 01, besides signifies 03, 05 through Sun. Lagna star lord is Venus, who signifies 02, 07, 08, 04. Planet posited in 08* house is Moon, who signifies 04, 08 and is in Saturn star, who signifies 02, 1O, and 11. Moon is under the aspect of Saturn and Venus. Hence, take houses O1, 02, 04, 07, 08, 10 and 11. 09* lord Jupiter aspects lagna from own house.
But the lagna is connected to 05* house (through Sun), so that the illness aspect is largely free from it.

The longevity aspects show maraca, badhaka and punya houses. It signifies medium longevity of 66 to 99 years. But out of running dashas, Venus was
 
Gerald Rudolf Ford
 
strongly connected to maraca and badhaka houses, which ran upto 52 years only.
Thereafter, Sun ran upto 58 years. Sun is lord of 05 and is in 3rd house. Moon signifies 04, OB, 10, 11 and 02. Mars is lord of 01 and 08, posited in Sun star (03, 05).
 
Next dasha of Rahu (Ju»12, 09, 02, 07, Sa» 02, 10, 11, 08, 04) was also suitable. Mars is connected to lagna, longevity and Punya houses. Whereas Jupiter singifies 09, 12, 02, 07 and aspects lagna, could the final emancipation.
 


Moon's position in Ayushkaraka Saturn star in the house of longevity, duly aspected by Saturn from Moon star is also a point to be considered for longevity aspects.
President Ford died on 26-Dec-2006 during Jup-Jup-Mer period at the age of 93 years. Antara lord Mercury is in 4* (end) and is aspected by Badhaka Saturn. The planetary positions on the date of death are given below:

Sir M Visveswarayya
 
Sir Visveswaraya died on 14 April 1962 during Venus dasha, Jupiter Bhukti and Jupiter Antara after living for 101 years.
Mercury is exalted is in own star, besides placed in Sun (09 and 10) star, Uthara.
There are three planets, viz. Mars, Jupiter and Saturn poslted in 09* House (punya). Sun and Moon are in own stars. Venus is in 11* house.
Ase star lord is Venus, who slgnifies houses viz. 06, 11, 11, Ma» 05, 12 and
09. Occupant is stronger. Hence Venus
 


will give result of 09 and 11 more strongly.
/ls:; sign lord Jupiter signfiies houses viz. 01, 04, 09, Ve» 06, and 11. Here
again 09 and 11 become stronger.
11 * house is an upachaya house (if it is not badhka) and stands for progress.
08 * bhava falls in Mercury star Aslesha in Cancer. Mera.iry is exalted and is posited in 10* house in the star of Sun, who signifies 09 and 10.
08* lord Moon is in 02nd house, but in own star, Sharavana. 03rd lord Saturn is in Venus star, signifying 02, 03, 09 Ve» 06 and 11.
All these aspects put together has given the native long life of 101 years, which is Puma Aayu.
In the chart No. 36 shown below is of a male nativity born on 02 Sep 1961 at 9-18 a.m. near Cochin, Kerala, with balance VMD of Moon dasha upto April 1965.

Jupiter is the lone planet signifies 06* house, besides aspect
 
of Saturn, Mars ard Mercury. Sun, Moon, Mars, Venus, Rahu and Ketu signifies 08* house. Rahu, Ketu, Mars and Mercury only signify 12* house. Mars, Rahu and Ketu only signifies 02, 07 (maraca) houses. Badhka (11*) house is signified by Sun, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu.
Either of O1, 05, 09 or 1O houses is signified by Sun, Moon, Mars, Venus, Saturn, Rahu or Ketu.
Moon is exalted and is occupant of 08* house but under aspect of 06* lord Jupiter. Mercury is exalted is in own house, but aspected by 06* lord Jupiter and also in moksha sthan. Lagna lord Venus is in 1O* house, but is aspected by 06* lord Jupiter. Illness will attack.
Urder this scenario, one felt that native will have 66-99 range of Madhya aayu or medium longevity.
M:x>n dasha will end at the age of 03 years and 07 months. Thereafter, the native will run VMD periods of Mars (upto 10y, 07m}, Rahu (upto 28y, 07m), Jupiter (upto 44y, 07m), Saturn (upto 63y, 07m) and Mercury (upto 80y, 07m).
The lagna falls in Mars star CMra in Libra. Libra is ruled by Venus, who is also lord of 08* house. 08* bhava will fall in Sun star Krithika. M:x>n is occupant of 08* house. 03rd house is vacant, its lord is Jupiter. Jupiter is in 04* house.
Out of above, Saturn is yogakaraka (04, 05, 11)for Moon sign as well as for lagna. Hence Saturn dasha is ruled out for death, which runs from 44 to 63 years of the native.
 


Next VMD is that of Mercury. Mercury is lord of 09 (Punya), but is posited in 12* (moksha) and is in the star of Sun (badhaka). Mercury is conjoined with Mars, who is lord of 02 and 07 in 12 (maraca and moksha). Mercury gets aspect of Jupiter, who signifies 11 and 4 predominantly rather than lordship of 03 and 06 houses. 04 * house is the end and 1 1 * is badhaka.
Under this combination, it is felt that native will not survive Mercury dasha. In the Mercury dasha, native will run Mercury-Mercury, Mercury-Ketu, Mercury-Venus and so on. Ketu is of course occupant of 05* house, but will signify 04 through Saturn and 02, 07, 12, 08, 10through Mars. Through Sun, Ketu will signify 01 and 08 also. Hence lagna (body), longevity (08), maraca, badhaka, moksha house are connected. Nodes are stronger. Hence this period shall be crucial for the native, which falls in 2027-2028 period, (at the age of 67 years).
During this period transit Saturn shall be in Aries, which happens to be 12* house (moksha) from Moon as well as the 3rd cycle of Saade Saath. At that period, transit Jupiter shall be in L.ro / Virgo.
In the chart No. 37 mentioned below, the native achieved only short longevity, who died in Nov 2008 in her Jupiter dasha, Saturn Bhukti and Moon Antara. Of course, the native was suffering from cancer.

Of the above, all planets are signifing either of the detrimental houses for lonevity, such as 02, 07 (maraca), 09 (badhaka), or 12 (moskha) except Saturn. But Saturn is under the aspect of Jupiter, who signifies 02 (maraca) and 09 (badhaka). Moon, both marakca and badhaka, is aspecting lagna (body).
Lagna lord Mars is posited in 12* house and is in the star of Rahu who signifies 06* house, thereby cabling a relationship with lagna (self) and 06 (disease). 08* lord Mercury is posited in own house, thus prompting one to say that the longevity is good. But
one should mark the Pai:a Kartari yoga for Mercury for being placed
in between Moon (Maraca and badhka) and Jupiter (maraca and badhaka). 08* lord Mercury is placed in badhaka (09) and maraka
(02) Jupiter star.
She was admitted in hospital with formation of water in the brain in the dasha of Jupiter-Saturn-Moon. Mark the connection of watery signs with Jup and Sat. Moon is a female planet, who is naturally a watery planet. Jupiter's and Moon's aspect on lagna (brain) has caused watery formation in brain. Jupiter's connection with 08* house made it excessive and serious in nature. Jupiter will itslef expand or make the bcx::ty part to swell. Saturn aspects Moon, while lagna lord Mars is connected to Rahu as well as 06* house. Hence, Saturn, Moon, IVlars and Ra.tu contributed for dreaded disease like cancer.
l-lence period became adverse and the native died in Jup-Sat-M:Jon period itself.

Caroline Kennedy is the only surviving child of late US President John F Kennedy. President Kennedy was assassinated on 22 Nov 1963 at Dallas, Texas State, by alleged assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, during Caroline's VMD of Mars-Ven-Rah period. Caroline was only 06 years old at that time and this indicates that the longevity of the father was too short-lived.
If lagna and 08* house are oonnected to maraca, badhka, rnoksha and dush-sthana houses, then the longevity of the native is under severe threat.
Fcr father 09* house is oonsidered for evaluation. For Caroline, Scorpio rising and 09* house falls in Ganoer. In this case maraca shall be Sun (lord of 02), Saturn (lord of 07) and badhaka is Venus (lord of 11 - for chara rashi). Planets, who signify 02, 07 and 11 houses, shall also function as maraca or badhaka.
Canoer is unoccupied. No planet aspects it. Its lord is Moon, who is posited in Shravana star in 07* house, which is maraca.
Ketu is in Venus star. Rahu is in Libra and is in own star. Henoe Rahu also signifies Venus. Henoe both Rahu and Ketu offer result of Badhaka. Planets posited in Rahu or Ketu stars also offer results of Badhaka, since they are Nodes. Mars is in Rahu star. Henoe Mars will offer badhaka result. Mercury, being lord of 12* house (Moksha) is in Moala star ruled by Ketu. Ketu is badhaka. Henoe Mercury offers result of badhaka through Ketu.
 


Hence planets who offer badhaka result are: Venus, Mars, Mercury, Rahu and Ketu.
02nd lord Sun (maraca) is posited in Anuradha star ruled by Saturn, who is lord of 07* house (maraca). Moon is posited in maraca house (07* house).
Hence planets who offer maraca result are Sun, Moon and Saturn.
Mars signifies badhaka and in whose star Jupiter is posited.
Besides, Jupiter aspects Moon from Mars star Chitra.
Hence almost all planets signifying either maraca or badhaka or moksha from 09* house made the longevity of father to have cut off so early at her very tender age of 06 years.
Meantime, a question was asked as to how shall be the longevity of the father of this baby girl born on   16, 2005 at Hyderabad at around 1-30 pm. The chart no. 39 is drawn and shown below:
If the lagna and / or 08 * house is connected to badhaka / maraca and dush sthanas, one's longevity shall be threatened.

Fcr father take 09* house as lagna and this falls in Scorpio. 08* there-from shall be Gemini. Moon is occupant of 08* house (Gemini). For sthira rashi (Scoprio), 09* shall be the badhaka. rvbon is the badhka lord and is posited in the house of longevity. This combination is detrimental for longevity of father (in this case). rvbon is in the star of Rahu, who signifies 05 and Jupiter. Jupiter is lord of 02 and is in 12 (maraca and moksha respectively).
Saturn is the lord of 3 (longevity) and ls in badhaka house. Saturn is in Aslesha star ruled by 08* lord Mercury. Hence Saturn gives the result of 03, 08 and 09. When a planet who signifies badhaka and longevity, the question of one's longevity shall be under threat.
08* lord is Mercury, who is posited in lagna, which should be treated as good for longevity. But Mercury is posited in the star of Saturn, who signifies badhka.
Jupiter, who is posited in Rahu star in 12* house (Moksha), being lord of 02 (Maraca), aspects badhka Moon who is posited in house of longevity.
Both rvbon and Jupiter are posited in Rahu star Arudra and Swati respectively. Although Rahu is posited in 5* house (punya), the dispositor of Rahu viz., Jupiter is maraca. Rahu ls in the star Saturn, who signifies badhaka and longevity.

1st marriage took place in Sept 1980 during Rahu-Moon-Venus, and was separated within 45 days. Divorce took place two years thereafter through a court of law. 2nd marriage took place in 1984 and this marriage is sustained.
Marriage houses are 7 (marriage), 2 (addition of a member) and 11 (long time relationship and fulfillment of desires). Marriage will take place when dasha / bhukti / antara promises and transit agree, if the chart promises. For separation, take 01, 06, 10 and 12* houses.
 


Lord of 07th house is Mercury, who is posited in L.agna in Purva Ashada Star ruled by Venus. Venus is lord of 06 and is posited in 12th house. Hence 07th lord itself agrees for separation.
First marriage took place during Rahu dasha, Moon Bhukti and Venus antara in Sept 1980. Rahu is conjoined with Venus (06, 11, 2, 3) and Saturn (02, 03, 12). Saturn, being lord of 02, is in own star in 12th house. Rahu, being Node, will give result of Saturn, Venus, Moon and Mars.
Bhukti lord Moon is posited in 06th house in own star, being lord of 08th house. But Moon is aspected by Venus and Saturn, who has got connection with houses such as 02 and 11. Hence Moon, though posited in 06, was prevailed upon by Saturn and Venus to solemnize marriage
Antara lord Venus signifies (06, 11, 02, and 03).
During that period, in transit, dasha lord Rahu was in Aslesha star ruled by 07th lord Mercury. Antara lord Venus was posited in Pushya star ruled by 2nd lord Saturn.
The native got separated from wife during Rah-Mon-Ven-Ketu period. Ketu gives the tendency to eject. Separation is seen from 06, 01, 10 and 12* houses. However, readers could see that Dasha
/ Bhukti / Antara lords also signify negative houses such as 01, 06,
and 12. Ketu also signifies 01 and 06 through Jupiter and Moon.
However, legal separation did not take place immediately which eventually happened at the onset of Jupiter dasha when Jupiter-Jupiter was operating. For all legal aspects Jupiter has to be connected to the pertinent houses. Jupiter is the lord of 1 and is posited in 10* house, which promises separation.
Native married again in Jupiter dasha, Saturn Bhukti. The girl's (second wife) janma star was Anuradha, ruled by Saturn. Her lagna was Scorpio, which was tenated by Saturn in her natal chart. In the boy's chart also Saturn is in Scorpio.
For 2nd marriage, normally 09* house is taken and 07, 02 and 11 along with Mercury and dual signs. 09* becomes 03rd (younger co-born) to 07* house, since 2nd wife becomes some sort of a younger sister to first wife.
 


Jupiter is posited in Sun star and hence signifies 09* house, while Saturn is lord of 02nd house. Hence Jupiter dasha gave divorce and second marriage. 07* lord Mercury is posited in Sagittarius, a dual sign, while Jupiter is lord of Sagittarius and Pisces and is posited in Virgo; all are dual signs.
Let us see another example (Chart no. 42): Female, born on 31-May-1971 at 00:10:am at Lat 16:34 N Long 80:40 E, had got
married in Jan 1991 and was divorced in 2004.

07* lord is Sun, who is posited in Moon star Rohini. Moon is posited in 07* house in Ketu star Makha. While Moon is lord of 06, star lord of Moon, Ketu, is posited in Aslesha star ruled by Mercury, in 06* house. Mars aspects Moon from 12* house.
Marriage took place in Venus dasha, Saturn bhukti and Mercury antara. Dasha lord Venus is lord of 04 and 09 and is posited in 03rd house in own star. Saturn is lord of 1 and 2 and is posited in Sun star and hence signifies 07* house. Mercury is lord of 05 and 08 and is posited in Venus star. Dasha and Antara lords Venus and Mercury respectively are under the aspect of Mars, who is in Moon star Shravana, while Moon is occupant of 07th house. Hence period favoured.
Divorce took place in 2004 most probably in Moon dasha, Moon bhukti. Moon is having connection with 06* very strongly, as discussed earlier.
 

In yet another case (Chart no. 43) of divorce, the boy was born on 30-Jun-1971 at 1-05 pm Vizag divorced his wife, who was born on 09-Jun-1974 at 7-00 am Kakinada.

The chart of the boy is appended above. Lagna is in Virgo and 07* house falls in Pisces. There are no occupants in Pisces. Jupiter is the lord of 07* house. Stars ruled by Jupiter are Punarvasu, Visakha and Purva Bhadrapada. Mercury is in Punarvasu and signifies 1 and 10, besides 3, 4 and 07. Moon aspects 07* house, who
signifies O1, 10, and 11.
But Jupiter is posited in Saturn star Anuradha. Saturn is lord of 5 and 06. Besides, Saturn aspects Jupiter from 09* house. Saturn is in Sun star Kruthika, who signifies 10 and 12.
Since 07* lord Jupiter has become weak, the native sought divorce in Jupiter-Jupiter period. Jupiter also will signify a judge and the divorce was granted through a court of law.
The chart (No. 44) of the girl is given below. Gemini is rising and 07* house is vacant. Lord of 07* house is Jupiter, who is in own star, Purvabh9-drapada. Lagna is occupied by Mercury and Saturn, who aspects 7th house. They are in Rahu star Arudra, while Rahu is in Mercury star in Scorpio, which becomes 06* ho se. Rahu will give result of Mars and Mercury along with 01 and 06. Mars is posited in 02nd house in Saturn star (1, and 06). The native got divorced in Rahu-Mars period.

The nakshatra ponthanam achieved are 23, while minimum required points are only 18.
But there is also a Kuja's placement mis-match in this case. In the chart of girl, Mars is posited in 02nd house from lagna while Mars is in 07* from Moon. In the boy's chart Mars is in 05* from Lagna and Moon, while Mars is in 09* from Venus.
Lord Ram of Ramayana
The following horoscope chart no. 45 ls supposed to be of that of Shri Ran of Ramayana fame. In the epic Ramayana, sage Valmiki narrates about the horoscope chart of P.am and his brothers, Bharat, Laxman and Shatrughna
Some Astra software specialists have calculated back the possible combination of the planetary positions as explalned by Sage Valmiki and concluded that the year of birth should be BC 5115.
Many astro pundits opine that the horoscope of Lord Rama including the position Mercury and Nodes are that the one illustrated below:

Horoscope of Lord Ram of Ramayana fame	Ase CAN Mon Jup
CAP
Mar		LEO
Rah SAG	sco	Sat  UB	VIR

The highlight of the horoscope is that 5 planets vlz. Sun, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are posited in their respective exaltation sign, which made many astrological researchers in the past to look at it with lot of anxiety and respect.
It is said that the thithi is sukla paksha navami and the Moon is posited in Punarvasu star ruled by Jupiter. Punarvasu star in Cancer is the last pada. which forms 3 deg. 20 min. only. Thus Lord Ram would have got the VMD of maximum of 4 years of Jupiter.
Sage Valmiki had neither mentioned about the planetary longitudes nor the star in which the planets posited, except for Moon.
When Moon is posited in Jupiter star and conjoined with Jupiter, they do aspect 07* house and offer the result of 06* house. When 07* is linked to 06* house, one could conclude that the harmony in marital life shall be too average.
On the other hand, 07* lord Saturn's position in 04th house shuns romance and the marital life should be just mechanical one.
 


05* lord Mars is posited in 07* should definitely bring in some romance between the couple. Occupancy of Mars in 07* house is perceived as Kuja dosha or Manglik. But for Cancer lagna, Mars is yogakaraka and is lord of O5* house (romance) cannot be construed as a factor for marital discord.
07* lord Saturn's aspect on 06th lord Jupiter and whose agent Moon, should be a contributory factor for prolonging the marital life.
Some mythological write ups proclaim that Sita mata was elder than Lord Ram.
When Mars, Saturn and Sun become significator of 07* house, one's first wife should be older than native, which is contrary to the conventional practice of wife being younger than husband.
In this case 07* lord Saturn is aspected by Sun and 07* is occupied by Mars. Thus the condition is satisfied.
Abduction is nothing but jail yoga. Stta Mata was abducted by Ravana, the demon king of Lanka, by deceiving the Rama brothers.
When lagna is connected to 03, 08, 12, one could be in the jail. For 07th house (Capricorn), Jupiter becomes lord of 03 and 12, who aspects lagna of wife (Capricorn). Sun is the significator of 08* house, who aspects 07* lord Saturn. Hence Sun and Jupiter (03, .08, 12), put together by their efforts, could abduct Sita mata. Rahu's position in 12* is definitely a contributory factor to the incarceration of Sita Mata. In that case, Saturn should have been placed in Rahu star Swati in Libra. 11 * lord Mars's position in lagna (Capricorn) has definitely helped Stta Mata to attain freedom from the clutches of Demon King Ravana.
Marital Disharmony and Prashna Theory
For marriage, take houses 02, 07 and 11. For divorce, take vyaya (negative) houses viz. 01, 06, 10. 12* house stands for loss in general. Houses 06 and 12 are detrimental for marital failures.
The following charts belong to a couple. The husband was born on 17 Feb 1970 at 3-45 pm at Mumbai (chart No. 46):

In the chart of the husband shown above, lagna is in Gemini. 07* house falls in Sagittarius at 26 deg. 33 min. at Purva Ashada star ruled by Venus. Venus is lord of 05* house, which promotes romance.
07* lord Jupiter is also posited in 05* house, which again promotes romance.
Then how did marital altercations have been reported? Definitely negative houses such as 01, 06, 10, 12 should be connected to 02, 07, 11 houses for creating flutter in marriage.
Mars is the lord of 06* house. There are no occupants of 06* house. Mars is posited in 10* house, which is a negative house for long time relationship. Mars is aspecting Jupiter (07* and 10* lord) by its 08* aspect, thereby causing rupture in 07* significations. l-lerce 06 and 10 are linked to 07* house.
Mars is lord of 11thhouse too. But by its position in 10* negates long time relationship. Besides, Mars is the planet who promotes quarrels and arguments. When Mars is in 10* house, one will behave independently and also try to dominate the other.
Stars ruled by Mars are Mrigashira, Ch ra and Dhanishta. Planet pos ed and Mars star is only Sun. Hence Sun also will give the result of 06, 11 and 10* houses.
 

Nodes connected with Mars are none. But Sun, an agent of Mars, is conjoined with Rahu, while Sun aspects Ketu. Hence Nodes, Rahu and Ketu, will give the result of Sun. Sun signifies negating houses 06 and 10. Hence Nodes will also contribute to give results of 06 and 10.
Any planet posited in Nodes' stars viz, Ashwini, Makha, Moala ruled by Ketu and Arudra, Swati and Satabhisha ruled by Rahu shall offer the result of the respective Node.
Jupiter is posited in Swati star. Venus and Rahu are posited in Satabisha. Hence Jupiter and Venus will offer result of Rahu. Rahu will give result of 06 and 10. Hence Venus and Jupiter also will provide result of06 and 10 houses. Of course, Venus is lord of 12.
Ketu will offer result of 06 and 10 through Sun. Planet posited in Ketu star {Ashwini) is only Saturn. So Saturn also gives result of 06, 10. Saturn aspects Jupiter. Hence Jupiter besides gives result of 06 and 10, under aspect of Mars and Saturn (both signifying 06 and 10), has become futile for offering 07* results.
These combinations all put together has made his marital life miserable.
It will not be out of place to mention here that it shall be unwise to blame any koota like nadi koota, yoni koota, gana koota, etc. for any case of a marital discord.
As regard the current planetary operating period viz. Vimshottari Maha dasha (VMD), the native is running Mercury dasha, Moon Bhukti and Sun Antara upto 1st week of August 2010.
Dasha lord Mercury is slightly perturbed in marital matters being lord of 01 (negation to 2-addition of a member), lord of 04 (negation to romance-5th house) and occupant of 08* house (impediments and obstacles). Mercury is aspected by Saturn, who signifies 06 and 10.
Saturn always promotes enmity.
 


Bhukti lord Moon is lord of 02 and occupies O1 st house. Moon is in the star of Jupiter (Punarvasu) lord of 07, 10 and occupant of 05* house. Moon hence in total signifies 01, 02, OS, 07, 10th houses. In these except 1O* house, all are favourable for marital matters. 1--bw does then Moon create rupture in marital life? The star lord of Moon is Jupiter, who signifies 06 and 1O* houses.
Antara lord is Sun, who, as it is, signifies 06 and 10 through Mars. Hence dasha, Bhukti and antara lords do promise for separation.
The wife was born on 19-Aug-1974 at 4-30 a.m., Bangalore, India, 77 E 35, 12 N 59 (Chart no. 47):

She is having Gemini rising in Arudra star ruled by Rahu at 11 deg. 18 minutes. 07* bhava in Sagittarius is falling in Ketu star Moola. Ketu is in 12* house, the house of loss. Planets posited in Ketu stars are Mercury and Sun. So they will give result of 07* and 12* house.
07* lord is Jupiter, who is posited in 09* house and is in own star. Hence Jupiter should be strong. Mars is the lord of 06* house, which negates marriage. Mars is aspecting Jupiter. Hence the marital discord has taken place.

The wife is going through VMD of Mars dasha, Sun Bhukti and Jupiter Antara. Mars signifies 06* house. Bhukti lord Sun signifies 12 and not 06* house. But it is conjoined with Mars. Next bhukti shall be of Moon. Moon signifies 02,03,12,05 houses through self and Venus. With this Mars dasha will be completed.
Next dasha shall be of Rahu. Rahu is posited in 06* house shall not be favouring for marital harmony.
Saturn brings in enmity. She is born in Purva star in Leo and transit Saturn in the second house from Leo, which means the last phase of Saade sath is being experienced by the native. Please note Saturn's placement in Punarvasu star ruled by Jupiter, while Jupiter is the lord of 07* house. Hence Saturn is connected to 07* house and brought in marital disharmony during its cycle over natal Moon.
In order to evaluate as to whether the couple will eventually separate or not, astrologers are required to take a time chart and study. Accordingly, a time chart is taken for the moment of judgement and the same is appended here below:-

Here in the horary or parshna chart, Libra rising at 07 deg. 50 min. and the corresponding 07* bhava falls in Ketu star. Ketu is in a dual sign and signifies Rahu and Mercury. Rahu in turn signifies Venus and Jupiter. Hence Ketu signifies 06* house through Rahu-Jupiter.
 


07* lord is Mars. Mars is posited in 12* house along with 04 * and 05 * lord Saturn. Both Saturn and Mars are signifying 1 1 * house through Sun. But Sun is in 10* house. Besides, Mars and Saturn are under the aspect of 06* lord Jupiter. Hence it is felt that the couple will separate and will go in for legal separation due to the connection of Jupiter.
What About Second Marriage?
The following chart no. 49 belongs to a female, who was married, but unfortunately divorced.
For second marriage take 09* house along with 07* and 11 * houses. 09 * house is the bhatru (younger) of 07* house, signifying second spouse. Mercury and dual houses signify duality of events. If these houses are somehow linked, then one could boldly declare that there will be second marriage for the native.

Saturn from 06* house. Saturn is in Krithika star ruled by Sun and Sun is in 1O* house. 06* and 1 O* houses negate 07 and 11 * houses which stand for marriage and longtime relationship. Hence the first marriage failed.
 

The parents, as usual, are anxious and worried. Question was raised as to whether this girl, who is now 40 years old, could marry again.
Rx serond marriage, take 09* house. If there is link between 07, 09 and 11, second marriage could be predicted.
07* bhava falls in Rohini star ruled by Moon, while the 09* bhava falls in Pushya star ruled by Saturn. Both Saturn and Moon are linked since Moon is in Anurada star ruled by Saturn. But Saturn is occupant of 06* house and is in the star of Sun, who occupies and holding lordship of 10* house. Hence Moon wlll give result of 06* house.
09* lord Moon aspects 07* house, but is not linked to 07* lord Venus. Mere aspect should take care of 2nd marriage. Unfortunately, Moon is signifying 06* house and aspects 07* house from lagna.
Mars is the lord of 06* house and is posited in a barren sign in Ketu star Makha in 10* house. Mars aspects 09* lord Venus.
All these combinations do not augment for a second marriage for the native.
Hence it was concluded and declared that there shall not be serond marriage for this native.
Moon, the index of the mind of one, signifies 06 and 01 in this case, the houses negate marriage. Hence native also shall say no to a second marriage.

Lagna falls in Leo at 26 deg 44 min. 07* Bhava therefrom shall be in Aquarius in Purva Bhadrapada star, ruled by Jupiter. If Jupiter or the 07* lord defines 07, 09, 11 then second marriage could be predicted. Take 02, dual signs, Mera.Hy and Mercury's stars for addition of a member and duality.
 

Jupiter is lord of 05, 08 and is posited in 11* house, in the star of Mars, who signifies 03, 04, 09. Hence Jupiter will give result of 05, 08, 11, 03, 04, and 09.

Unconventional  Marriages
Second Hand Spouse
The title looks little sarcastic by saying second hand spouse. There are some occaslons when a person is married to an already married person. In such cases one could address that person as a second hand spouse (elther husband or wife).
The astrological combinations found for marrying an already married person is that Saturn, Mars and Mercury, who are connected to 7* house. Saturn is the planet who signifies old, second hand item, etc.
When Rahu is involved in that connection the person shall be from other caste.
Let us see few examples and visualize if these combinations are really working well in these charts: Chart No. 51

In this chart Ketu, being a Node, will give the result of Mercury, Sun, Moon, Saturn, Rahu and Venus. When Saturn, Sun and Mars signify 09th house, second wife shall be older than him.
09th bhava star lord is Saturn. 09th lord is Jupiter and in whose star Sun is posited. Venus, who is posited in Mars star Chitra, aspects 09th house. Hence 2nd wife of Prince Charles was older than him.

Wives
President Harrison's 1st wife was Caroline Scott and second wife was Mary Dimmick.
Mary Dimmick (April 30, 1858 - January 5, 1948) was the second wife of President Harrison. She was 25 years younger than Harrison, and was the niece of his first wife.
On October 22, 1881, Mary had married Walter Dimmick, a son of the attorney-general of Pennsylvania. But Walter died three months after their marriage, leaving her a widow at age 23.
A niece of Caroline, she, in 1889 moved into the White House to serve as assistant to the First Lady. Sometime after Mrs. Harrison's death in 1892, the former president and Mrs. Dimmick fell in love and late in 1895 announced their engagement
09th bhava falls in Saturn star Uthara Bhadra in Pisces and Saturn is the lord of 07* house. Saturn is posited in a dual sign, Virgo. Hence Saturn is connected to 07 (marriage) and 09 (second marriage). 07th lord Saturn aspects 09th house. Hence the second marriage took place for President Harrison.
The age difference between President Harrison and his second wife Mary Dimmick was 25 years, which is considered extra-ordinary age difference and unconventional.
 


09th lord is Jupiter, who js placed in Venus star Bharani and signifies Venus. Jupiter is aspected by Moon. Mercury is posited in Ketu star Makha, while Ketu signifies Venus. Moon is in Rahu star and signify Rahu, who in turn signifies both Jupiter and Venus. Hence, Venus, Moon and Mercury, through Ketu drove Harrison to marry a too younger woman,

Burton was married five times, first to Sybil Williams from 1949 to 1963, with whom he had two children, actress Kate Burton and Jessica Burton. He was married twice, consecutively, to Elizabeth Taylor (15 March 1964 - 26 June 1974 and 10 October 1975 - 29 July 1976). The first marriage took place in Montreal. Their second marriage occurred sixteen months after their divorce, in the Chobe National Park, Botswana.
First Marriage
Saturn is placed in 07th house and is in the star of Jupiter, who signifies 09th house, enabling duality of marriages. But, Mars is posited in 07th house and is in the star of Rahu, who is in 4th house.
 

4th house being vyaya to 5th (romance), there may not be much bve in marital life for the native.
Second Marriage
07th lord Venus is posited along with Jupiter in 09th house in Sagittarius, a dual sign. 11th lord Saturn is posited in 07th house.1st lord Mars is posited in 07th house.
Third Marriage
11th lord Saturn is posited in 07th house paving way for 3rd marriage.
Fourth Marriage
L.agna lord Mars is in 07* house, giving way for 4th marriage.
Fifth Marriage
Third Lord Mercury is not connected to 07th house, but Venus, being lord of 07th house, aspects 3rd house.
Negation To Marriage
But 06th lord Mercury is in own star and is not linked to Saturn, Mars, or Venus for negating the marriage.
But Saturn (lord of 10th house) and Mars (lord of 01st house) are signifying 07th house. 06th bhava falls in Sun star in Virgo. Sun signifies 07th house through Saturn. Hence Sun signifies 06th and 07tti houses and thereby causing rift and separation in marital life.
These combinations made Sir Burton to go through a situation of 'marry-divorce-marry'.

Mercury always signifies duality along with dual signs.
The lagna rising is Leo in Purva star ruled by Venus at 16 deg. 30 min. and the corresponding 07th bhava falls in Aquarius in Rahu star Satabhisha. Saturn is the lord of 071h house, who is posited in 09* lord Mars star, Chitra in Libra. Mercury is posited in 09th house (second spouse) and aspects 071h lord Saturn. Mercury is also the lord of 11th house (third spouse).
Hence Mercury who signifies 09 and 11 and its aspect on Saturn, who is in 09th lord Mars star paved way for multiple marriage. Mars is posited in 06th house. Although Saturn is lord of 06 and 07th house, by virtue of Saturn's placement in Mars star with Mars in 06th house has definitely caused separation in marital alliance.
In that sequence, 1st lord should be the 4th spouse. The lord of 1st house is Sun, who is posited in Moon star (12th lord) in 10th house (negation to 11), should have definitely not created a way for yet another marital alliance.

Extra Marital Affairs
Some persons do indulge in extra marital affairs, thanks to the planetary combinations. Mercury or signs viz. Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces notify duality. Planets posited in the stars of Mercury, such as Aslesha, Jyeshta and Revati shall also signify Mercury and hence duality. Nodes posited in Gemini or Virgo will also signify Mercury.
07th house signifies marriage and spouse. 03rd will signify younger co-barns. Hence 09th shall be younger co-born for 07* house or a second spouse.
Being a mystical house, 08th house when connected to 07th, shall indicate secret pursuits with reference to spousal affairs. 12t11 house shall be the secret affairs, loose sex life, including bed pleasures. Jupiter is putra-karaka and Venus signifies love affairs along with 05th house. Saturn flouts rule or does not care about the rule.
Conjunction or mutual aspect or exchange of houses or stars between Venus and Moon who together signify womenfolk have to be taken into consideration.

Lagna is in Mars sign, Saturn star. Moon is in Saturn sign and Rahu star. Day is ruled by Jupiter. Hence ruling planets are Mars, Saturn, Rahu and Jupiter. Since Node, who is in Venus star, take Venus also.
In the prashna chart, lagna is rising in Anuradha star in Scorpio. 07* lord is Venus, who is posited in 09* house in Cancer in Aslesha star ruled by Mercury. 09* house when connected to 07 indicates second wife. Mercury signifies duality.
Mars is lord of O1, 06, is posited in 10* house in the star of Venus, who signifies 07, 12, 09. Hence the horary chart does not
 

promise of a compromise with the wife. Instead, the native may divorce his wife in Venus dasha, Mars Bhukti running up-to October 2010.
It is not men alone who go in search of a seoond relationship. Women get maximum bad name in this line. Wine and Women have been hand in hand from time immortal. Mostly women who make this kind of relationship as profession, is called prostitution.

Denial of Marriage
Most people do get married in their life time, however some do not. Astrology should be a perfect tool to diagnose as to why a person is not fortunate enough to marry.
For marriage, take 07* house as the real house of marriage with 02 and 11 as supporting house. 05* is celebration while 08* becomes 02nd to 07* house. Some Astrologers consider 05 and 08* house too. Jupiter and Venus are the planets who signify marriage.
When 02, 07, 11 houses are connected to its negating houses viz. 01, 06 and 10 along with 12* house (loss) and barren signs, marriage could be denied. Take barren signs for fixing the final nail on this aspect. Gemini, Leo and Virgo are considered barren signs. Take Saturn as delay master. Conjunction or aspect of between Saturn and Moon could cause delays, cancellation of proposals and even engagements.

Leo rising and 07* lord Saturn is posited in 3rd house and is in Visakha star ruled by Juptter. Jupiter is lord of 06* house and is posited in 12* house in own star and hence marriage is denied. Jupiter being lord of 06 and 09, is posited in 12* house in own star caused the problem. Had Jupiter been in the star of Saturn (Pushya), the chances of marriage should have been brighter in this case.
The conjunction of Saturn with Moon, causing punarphoo dosha, has also contributed to denial of marriage in this case.
The person was born in Jupiter dasha with balance of 06 years and 06 months. Thus, he will run Saturn VMD upto 25 years and 06 months. Thereafter, Mercury dasha shall run upto 42 years and 06 months. The significations of Jupiter and Saturn are discussed here-above. Mercury is lord of 02, 11 and is posited in 10* house. Out of these houses, Mercury will give more result of 10* house, which is negating 11 * house.
07* bhava falls at 26 deg. 20 min. in Aquarius, which corresponds with Purva Bhadra star ruled by Juptter. Jupiter is in own star in 12* house and is aspected by delay master Saturn.
Another native was born on 11-Nov-1958 at 23-59 hours !ST, New Delhi, India, is yet to be married. (Chart no. 74).

In this case lagna falls at 27 deg. 17 min. in Pisces. 07* house shall be in Virgo, a barren sign. Lord of Virgo is Mercury, who is posited in Saturn star Anuradha in Scorpio. Saturn is the delay master. Saturn aspects 07* house. Mercury is aspected by Mars from Sun Star Kruthika. Mars will give result of 06* house. Sun is lord of 06* house, which negates marriage.
Rahu is occupant of 07* house and is in the star of Mars (06* house).
 


07th bhava falls at 27 deg. 17 min in Virgo, which is corresponding to Chitra star ruled by Mars. Mars signify 06* house through Sun, since posited in Krithika star.
VMD Dasha ran for the native are: Jupiter upto 06 years and 11 months, Saturn upto 25 years and 11 months, Mercury upto 42 years and 11 months, Ketu upto 49 years and 11 months.
As per the social and traditional custom followed now-a-days, marriageable age could be during Saturn dasha (in this case). Saturn is posited in 1O* house and aspects 07* house. Saturn gets the aspect of Mars (06* house significator). Next dasha is that of Mercury, who is again getting the aspect of Mars. All these combinations led the native not to marry in her life.

Lagna is at 21 deg. 38 min. in Sagittarius, and the corresponding 07* bhava falls in Gemini at the same longitude in Jupiter star Punarvasu. Gemini is a barren sign. Jupiter is in 12* house in Saturn star Anuradha. Saturn, the delay master, aspects 07* house as well as Moon.
Venus is the lord of06* house, which normally deny marriage, is posited in Jupiter star Purva Bhadra. Hence Venus denies marriage. Jupiter gets the aspect of Mars from 06* house. Hence 07* bhava star lord Jupiter becomes weak to offer marriage.
07* lord is Mercury, who is in 3rd house in Rahu star, Satabhisha. Rahu is in 10* house in Moon star Hastha in Virgo and signifies 07* house through Moon and Mercury. Hence Mercury and Rahu should be favouring for marriage.
But Moon is occupant of 07* house, being lord of 08* house. Mars is posited in Rohini star in 06* house. Hence Mars signifies 06 and 07 to deny marriage.
Upto the 41st year of the native, the VMD ran were that of Rahu, Jupiter and Saturn. Marriageble age should have been in Jupiter and Saturn periods, but they did not favour for a marital alliance. Of course, marriage could take place in Mercury period also which ran from 41 st year to 58 years, since Mercury being lord of 07* house. Mercury is aspected by Saturn, and is conjoined with Sun. Sun signifies 06* house through Mars.
Unfortunately, all these combinations created no marital bliss
for the native.
A male nativity, born on 28 July 1946 at 04.36 a.m. Chennai, India, 80 E 17, 13 N 04, is yet to be married. (Chart no. 76):

In this case, lagna falls in Jupiter star, Punarvasu, in Gemini. 07* lord is Jupiter. There are no occupants of 07* house. There are no planets posited in the stars of Jupiter. Hence Jupiter alone becomes significator of 07* house. Jupiter is posited in Virgo in the star of Mars. Mars is lord of 06* house. Saturn, the delay master, is aspecting 07* lord Jupiter. Moon is conjoined with Saturn in Cancer.
07* bhava falls in Venus star Purva Ashada. Venus is in own star, belong lord of 05, 12 and posited in 03rd house. Venus is
 


conjoined with Mars, who is lord of 06* house, besides aspecting 06* house.
Both Jupiter and Venus are posited in barren signs, viz. Virgo and Leo respectively.
Native was born in Saturn VMD with balance of approx. 18 years. Then on, upto 35 years, the native will have Mercury dasha. Thereafter, Ketu dasha ran for next 07 years and Venus for next 20 years, i.e., upto 62 years. Mercury is lord of 01 and 04 and is posited in 2nd house in own star. Mercury is the lord of 06* bhava in Scorpio, being at 22 deg. 57 min. in Jyeshta star. Ketu signifies 06* house, Mercury and Mars. The significations of Venus are already discussed. Hence the combinations illustrated above, did not favour for a marital life.
Native, a girl, born on July 19, 1973 at 08-20 a.m. IST at 79 E 39, 10 N 46, near Tanjore, Tamil Nadu, India, is yet to get married. (Chart no. 77)

In this case, Leo is rising in the eastern horizon at 05 deg. 40 min. in Makha star ruled by Ketu. Saturn is lord of 07* house, who is posited in 11* house, but in a barren sign.
Moon is occupant of 07* house and in whose star, Sharvana, Jupiter is posited in 06* house. Hence Jupiter will give result of 06 and 07, besides lord of 05 and 08. Jupiter gets aspect of Sun, Mercury and Venus from 12* house. Occupant Moon is lord of 12* house, and is posited in the star of Rahu. Rahu is in 5* house and gets aspect of Saturn, being lord of 07* house. This combination should be favourable, but in this chart, the bliss of marital life was spoiled by Jupiter, who was aspected by Sun and Mercury from Saturn star, who is the delay master.
The native was born with balance VMD of Rahu 08 years and 05 months. Subsequent VMD shall be of Jupiter upto 24 years, Saturn upto 43 years and Mercury upto 60 years.
Dasha. lord Saturn signifies 07* house. But Saturn is in a barren sign and is aspected by Mars, who is signifies 04, 08, 09, 11, 12, 03 houses through self and Mercury. Besides, Saturn is lord of 06* house.
All these combinations did not permit native to have the marital bliss.
Rachel Carson, was an American marine biologist and author of ''The Sea.Around Us," 1951, and "Silent Spring," 1962, as well as two other popular books about ocean life.
In addition, Carson, through her writing, made science accessible, beautiful and exciting to the common person.
Carson warned the public about the dangers to waterfowl of DDT, and that introducing DDT into the North American ecosystem could "upset the whole delicate balance of nature." Carson's prophecies about the dangers of pesticides had come true. She was a spinster.

Saturn is in own star and aspects both 07* house as well as its lord Mercury from 1st house. Moon is posited in Saturn star and aspects 07* lord Mercury.
The native ran 12 years and 03 months of Saturn dasha and Mercury dasha upto 29 years, Ketu upto 36 years, and Venus upto 56 years.
Mercury is lord of 07* house, but is aspected by Saturn and Moon, besides conjoined with 06* lord Sun. Ketu is in 11 * house, but signifies Sun and Saturn. Venus signifies 03, 08, 02 and is in the star of Ketu who signifies 11 * house.
Hence Sun, Saturn and Moon put together brought about the denial aspect in marital life for the native.

In this chart of native born in 1944, lagna falls in Sun star Uthara in Virgo. Corresponding 07* bhava falls in Pisces in Jupiter star. Jupiter is in 11 * house and aspects 07* should automatically give the native a marital life.
Jupiter is conjoined with Rahu, who is in Saturn star. Hence Rahu will give the result of both Saturn and Jupiter viz. 06 and 07 houses. The star lord of Rahu is Saturn, who is in a barren sign. Besides, 06* lord Saturn aspects 07* house through its 10* aspect.
 

Saturn is posited in Mars star Mrigashira star ruled by Mars. 06* bhava falls in 01 deg. 05 min. in Aquarius, which shall correspond with Dhanishta star ruled by Mars. Mars is posited in a barren sign in Jupiter star, who is lord of 07* house. Hence Mars gives the result of 06* bhava and 07* house.
All these combinations led the native to not getting married.
Native was born in Sun dasha and marriageable age shall be during Mars / Rahu main periods or even than of Jupiter. Jupiter should be strong to give marriage, but Mars and Rahu are not favourable. It could be concluded that although Jupiter was strong to give marriage, because of Rahu's significations and Saturn's aspect on 07* house, the marriage did not materialize.
 


25
Children or Progeny
The main concept of marriage and marital life is for "vamsha vardhana" or for continuance and prosperity of one's generation. Hence it is essential and most important that Astrologer should check the aspect of progeny.
Children born to a couple could be either male alone or female alone or both genders. In some cases twin children could also be born. Delay and denial of children are the main aspect for Astrologer to verify.
If the progeny is not promising, the marriage matching should not be done with that chart, and the native may be asked to adopt a child. In some cases people do go in for the sperm-donor system.
If 5* lord or house is heavily afflicted, then there will be problems in having progeny.
Fa child birth, one could take 02, 05 and 11 * houses. 02 house stands for addition of a member, while 05* is child birth. 11* house stands for fulfillment of desires, besides it is 5th house of spouse.
 

Let us see if chart Mo. 80, which is appended below, promises child birth or not:

The female nativity, is born on Oct 27, 1980 at 1042 pm at Hyderabad, India, was blessed with a female child on 16 Dec 2005 at around 1-30 pm.
Child birth took place in Jupiter-Mercury-Mars period. 5* house is well fortified although lord of 5*, Venus, is posited in 04* house. Planets posited in 5* house are Mercury and Sun. Venus and Jupiter are posited in Sun star, while Rahu and Mars are posited in Mercury star. Hence Jupiter dasha, Mercury bhukti and Mars antara, child birth took place.
The baby was born on 16 Dec 2005 at 1-30 pm with Ase. rising in dasha lord Jupiter sign (Pisces) in Revati star ruled by Mercury. Moon was in Gemini ruled by Bhukti lord Mercury (with Moon) in Arudra star ruled by Rahu. In the chart of the mother of the child, Rahu is posited in Bhukti lord Mercury star, Aslesha. Transit Jupiter was in Swati star in Libra, which corresponds to mother's 5* house.
In the chart No. 81 mentioned for a male nativity born on 02 Sep 1961 at 9-18 am near Cochin, Kerala, the child birth took place on 26 May 1990 at 13-30 pm. during his Jup-Jup-Jup vrv'ID period. The child was born with lagna rising in Sun star in Leo and Moon in Arudra star ruled by Rahu in Gemini.

Dasha lord Jupiter, who is also putra karaka is posited in 04* house, but is in Utharasada star ruled by Sun. Sun is lord and occupant of 11 and is strongly disposed for 11* house matters_ Sun is aspecting 05* house. Hence child birth is promised. But 05* lord being Saturn, the child was born on a Saturday with Saturn as significator of lagna (in Leo) of the child.
Twins
If you ask God Almighty for one child, God blesses you with two children at a time, which is called twins.
Kalyan Verma's Saravalli vide Chapter 8 stanzas cited below states that:-
Stanza -16:Twin Birth. If the Sun and Jupiter be in Gemini, or Sagittarius in aspect to Mercury, birth of two male children be predicted. Two female children will be born, if Venus, Mars and the Moon be in Pisces, or Virgo in aspect (of) Mercury.
Stanza - 21-22: One Male Child and one female child to be born, should Lagna and Moon be in even Raceis and be aspected by a strong planet, then there are twins in the womb (one male child and one female child). Similar results follow, if the Moon and Venus are in even Raceis, or common Signs and be strong.
 

This particular rule mentioned under stanza 16 for female twins, the same is tested and found to be correct. If k:r, lord, Mars and 3rd lord are conjoined and connected with a twin (dual) sign, twin birth could be predicted.
Case no. 82: Please see the horoscope chart of mother of the very above twins.

As per Kalyana Verma's Saravalli Chapter 8, stanza 16   Venus, Mars, Moon in aspect of Mercury and when they are placed in Pisces (a female sign) twin girls will be borne.
Here in this case, Moon is not conjoined with other planets, but is placed in Mercury's house, a dual house and is in the star of Jupiter, dual house ruler. 5* lord is Venus (lord of progeny) and hence twin girls were borne to the native. Hence mother's chart indicates twin girl daughters, while daughters' chart should definitely indicate twin birth.
There are many rules and planetary combinations, which could cause twin births. Some of them have not been dealt here.
 

Ole combination is that the t,sc, lord (being Mars - significator for co-barns) is placed in any of Mercury stars such as Aslesha, Jyesta or Revathi, with the 3rd lord signifies a double-bodied house and connected to Mercury will cause dual birth.
Chart no. 83: Kusuma (elder of the twin girls) born June 09, 2004 at 05-37 pm at Hyderabad, India, while the younger (of the twin girls) was born at 5-40 pm.

Here you will see that the t,sc, lord Mars (self and younger co-boms) and 3rd lord Saturn (younger co-barns) are placed in Gemini, a twin sign. Besides, there are no planets in any of the stars owned by Mercury, in order to signify duality. But both Saturn and Mars are Mercury sign. The question of duality connected with t,sc, and 3rd lord are satisfied, and this indicates that natives are born as twins.

The Ase lord Moon is placed in Venus star Purva Phalguni and hence signifies Venus. Venus is posited in Mars (co-barns) star Chitra in a dual sign, Virgo. 3rd lord Mercury is placed in Jupiter (lord of two double-bodied houses) star Visakha. Ketu who is conjoined Mercury is again placed in Mars star Chitta. Ase lord Moon is placed with Jupiter (lord of twin houses). L..agna falls in Saturn star Pushya, whereas Saturn is posited in Pisces, a dual sign and is in mutual aspects with.
These combinations ensured that the native is born as twin.

Ase lord  aturn is in 3rd house (hOuse ot co-borns). Mars is lord of 3rd house (co-barns) and also is the natural significating planet for younger co-borns. Mars is placed in a dual bodied sign, i.e., Gemini, in the star of Punarvasu ruled by Jupiter. Ps::. lord Saturn and 3rd lord Mars are getting the aspect of Jupiter, lord of two double-bodied sign, who is also placed in Mars star Chitra.

Here in this case just see that Sagittarius is rising and the lord Jupiter is placed in Chitra star owned by Mars, who is the natural
 

karaca for co-borns. The third lord (signifying co-borns) Saturn is placed in a dual sign Virgo, owned by Mercury. Besides, Saturn is also placed in Chitra Star. Mercury, a planet of duality is placed in Jupiter star Visakha, signifying duplication for kl:, (self).
3rd lord Saturn is in a dual bodied house and is in Mars star Chitra. Mars is the natural karaka for younger co-borns, whereas Jupiter being lord of lagna signifies self, is also is in Mars star Chitra.
These combinations are sufficient enough to reckon that the native is born as twins.
Now let us see the chart no. 87 of the father, President George W Bush. to verifv for anv indication for twin children.

5* house should signify the first child and 7* house (being 3rd from 5*) should signify the 2nd child. Mars is the natural karaca for co-borns.
The 5* lord Mars is placed in Venus star Purva, whereas Venus is conjoined with Mercury, a planet of duality. Mercury is also conjoined 7* lord Saturn in Ase. Ketu who is placed in 5* house should signify 5* lord Mars. Ketu is placed in Mercury star Jyeshta again signifying duality. Hence twins were born.
 

The readers could infer from the examples and analysis explained above for twin births, the rules prescribed in Saravalli do hold good, but other combinations will also have to be looked into.
 
26
Delay in Birth of Children

There are many combinations for delay in child birth.
Saturn or Saturn with Ketu connection and when they are connected to putra sthana i.e., 5* house or 5* lord along with barren signs cause delay in birth of children could be predicted.
Please see the chart no.88 above, born on 2nd May 1979 at 00-30 hours, Hyderabad.

The native has lost foetus while in the 5  month of pregnancy. Eventually the native was blessed with twin females on 09* June 2004. The VMD period of birth of children is Sat-Sun-Mon period.
Take houses 5 (progeny), 02 (addition of a member) and 11 (fulfillment of desire as well as 05* from spouse) for child birth.
Dasha lord Saturn and Bhukti lord Sun are posited in Venus star who is lord of 5* house (progeny). Antara lord Moon is significant of 07* house and is posited in putra karaka Jupiter star. Moon also gets aspect of 11 * lord Mars from a fruitful sign. 07* house becomes the 2nd issue for a native.
 
The reasons for loss of progeny while in the womb are because of the connection of Mars, a maraca and lord of 4* with 5* lord Venus. 4* lord should negate 5* lord by conjunction. Putrakaraka Jupiter is aspecting both Venus and Mars. This ensures progeny. If so, why the baby was dead in mother's womb itself? Jupiter is placed in Saturn star Pushya and hence Jupiter there becomes an agent of Saturn only. Hence Saturn is connected to Putra or progeny indirectly. Both Saturn and Sun are posited in 5* lord Venus star Pubba and Bharani respectively. No other planet is posited in Venus star. tv'loon is placed on Jupiter Star and signifies Putrakaraka Jupiter. Hence birth of child took place during Sat-Sun-Mon period.
Once we look at the transit chart at the time of child birth, we may find that Venus, being lord of 5* was placed in 5* house, while Jupiter was in Venus star Pubba (Purva). Saturn was aspecting transit Jupiter and natal Venus. Rahu was transiting in Venus star pubba and in natal chart, Rahu was conjoined Saturn. In the natal chart Moon was in Jupiter star Puna.rvasu and while in transit chart, Moon was in Purva Bhadra, another Jupiter star.
Let us analyse how child birth took place in the following chart no. 89, who was born on 02 Sept 1961 at 9-18 am Cochin, India, with balance Moon dasha upto Sept 1965.

For progeny, take 02 (addition of a membet}, 5 (child birth) and 11 (fulfillment of desires and 05* house to spouse). 01, 04 and 10 are the negating houses to 02, 05 and 11. 12* house stands for loss in general.
 

Lord of 05* is Saturn, who is in 04* house, which negates child birth. But Saturn is conjoined with Putrakaraka Jupiter. Venus in Saturn star and is in Cancer, a fruitful sign. Venus signifies 01, 08, 10, 04 and 05. Although Venus signifies 01 and 04* houses, 05* house is good. Sun aspects 05* house while Ketu is posited in 05* house in Mars star, Dhanishta. Ketu is the natural aborter.
Rahu-Moon-Sat period in May 1988 saw an abortion by wife. But eventually, the native was blessed with a son during Jup-Jup-Jup.
Rahu is posited in Makha star ruled by Ketu, who is an aborter. During the period of abortion transit Saturn was posited in Ketu star Moola.
When the child birth took place, transit Jupiter was in Rahu star in Gemini and was aspecting the natal 05* house of native (Aquarius). Saturn had made the first return to Capricorn, in the native's life.
 

27
Absence of Progeny
Couples do get married. Marriages are said to have been decided in heaven. But some people are denied progeny. Using Astrology as a tool, one could really forsee if progeny is promised.
Barren sign is a sign of the Zodiac that, according to ancient astrological tradition, is not likely to possess strong powers of procreation, i.e. they are "barren." The signs most associated with infertility are Gemini, Leo, and Virgo, who are called barren signs. In addition, Aries, Sagittarius, and Aquarius are also believed to quite often have problems in matters of reproduction and are therefore considered semi-barren.
While 2, 5 and 11 which are the houses who contributes for progeny, the negating houses such as 1,4,10 will negate the issue of progeny. 12* house may be taken as house of loss in general. Barren signs and Eunuchs will play their role. Saturn, Mercury, Rahu and Ketu are Eunuchs. 8* house is treated as house of delays and impediments.
Let us examine few examples where the natives were not blessed with children:-
ln the chart no. 90 mentioned below of male nativity, born on 22 July 1970 at 7-00 am at Hyderabad, the native is 39 years old as of 2009 and is not blessed with children. The native is born with Jupiter VMD upto Aug-1985.

5* house, which falls in Scorpio, is vacant. There is no Ketu (aborter) connection with 5* house. 5* lord Mars is in Saturn star while Saturn is in Aries. Saturn is in Sun star and Sun is again in Saturn star (Pushya). Jupiter is Putrakaraka is in Mars star in 4* house (negation to 5th). The signification of Mars is already discussed. Here Sun, Mars along with Saturn do not contribute towards progeny.
From Moon sign (Aquarius), Gemini becomes 5* house, (a barren sign) and its lord Mercury is conjoined with Mars and Sun who are in Saturn star, besides Mercury is placed in own star.
Dasha ran from 15* year to 34 year was of Saturn, who is lord of 07 and 08 and is posited in 10* house in the star of Sun who signifies 1 and 2. Saturn gets aspect of Jupiter from 4* house, who is in Mars star Chitra, which is negating 5* house (progeny).
Now, let us examine the following charts belonging to a couple:
 

Female (Chart No. 91) born at 9:30 pm, on 28 Sep 1962 in Chennai, India, with balance Moon dasha upto Aug-1972. Her husband was born at 11:10 pm, 26 Feb 1965 in Mumbai.

Let us take the horoscope of the wife first. Taurus is rising with balance Moon VMD runs upto Aug 1972. Moon, Sun and Mercury are in 5* house. Sun is lord of 4 and all these planets are posited in barren sign, Virgo. Mercury being lord of 5* is exalted, but is in the star of Mars. Mars is also posited in a barren sign, Gemini.
From the age of 17 to 35 the native ran the period of Rahu and thereafter upto 51 years Jupiter. The period of real youth was in Rahu Mahadasha.
 
VMD lord Rahu signifies 05* house through Moon and Saturn, but Saturn is in Moon star and Rahu is in Moon house. Hence Moon who holds the trump card is in own star in a barren sign, Virgo, denied children in Rahu VMD.
Next VMD is of Jupiter, who signifies 08, 10 and 11, who is again posited in Rahu star.
Hence as discussed above about Rahu significations, native was not blessed with progeny.
Readers may now check the husbanc 's chart no. 92.

5* lord is in 5* house, who is conjoined with Sun, Mercury and Venus. Saturn, Sun and Mercury are in Rahu star, Satabisha. They will give result of Rahu. Venus is in Mars star Dhanishta. Rahu is in Mars star in 8* house. Mars is Sun star in a barren sign and aspects all planets posited in 5* house. Putrakaraka Jupiter is in a semi-barren house. These combinations do not contribute for child birth.
' The native was born in Venus dasha upto March 1971 i.e., upto 6 years. Thereafter Sun dasha for 6 years and Moon for 10 years, Mars for 7 years and Rahu for 18 years. Hence during youth, Mars and Rahu are operated. Both Rahu and Mars do not promote child birth as per the chart.
 

In another example (chart no. 93) of male born on 17 rv1ar
1958 at 17-08 hours Hyderabad, India.

The analysis should go in the following way:-
a)	5* house is occupied by Saturn who is placed in Ketu star Moola in Sagittarius in a semi barren sign. Ketu is a naturally an abortive planet while Ketu is in a semi barren house in own star.
b)	5* lord is Jupiter, who is placed in Rahu star and is conjoined with Rahu, who is in own star. Hence Rahu along with Jupiter will give mostly the result of Venus, since being in Libra.
c)	Venus is lord of 3 and 10 (negation to 11) and is posited in 6* house. Venus will give result of 6 more than 3 and 10. 6* is negation to 7* house (2nd child). Venus is in Moon star in 7* house. But Moon is in Mars star and Mars signifies 6* house. Again Moon is negating 2nd issue through Mars.
d)	7* lord Saturn, who could contribute 2nd child ls already in Ketu star. Ketu is in Aries, a semi-barren sign.
In the circumstances, eventually the native was not blessed with any children.
The chart no. 94 illustrated below is that of a female born on 02nd May 1979 at 00-30 hours in Hyderabad, South India, with
 
Capricorn rising in star Sharvana star ruled by Moon with nakshatra of Punarvasu in Gemini.

In this chart, the husband was declared as impotent with a very low sperm count, which prompted the couple to seek assistance from a sperm bank for birth of children.
What could be the reason for husband not to have sperm count to have his own children?
05* house stands for child birth. In order to evaluate the progeny issue of spouse, the chart should be rotated to 07th house and take it as lagna.
Cancer shall be the 07* house, and counting there-from Scorpio becomes the 05* house for spouse. 05* bhava falls at 10 deg. 24 min. which corresponds to Anuradha star ruled by Saturn. From 07* house, Saturn becomes lord of 07 and 08, posited in 02nd house in the star of Venus, who signifies 04, 11 and 09. Saturn, a eunuch, is posited in a barren sign, Leo. Saturn also signifies 04* house which negates 05* house. Venus is posited in Mercury star, who is also a eunuch. These factors contributed for no child birth or very low sperm count for the husband.

Death is seen from Bhadaka, Maraka, and Mokashakaraka planets during their periods. Her husband died on 20th Dec 2001 during Rahu-Venus-Sun-Mars period.
Spouse should be seen from 7* house. 7* Cusp falls in Mars sign in Aries. Bhadhaka for Aries is Saturn and sign is Aquarius. Maraka for Aries is 2nd and 7* lords, which in this case is Venus. Mars is in Venus star and will give result of Venus. Sun is in Rahu star and will signify Rahu. Besides Sun and Mercury are in Badhaka house. Hence the period of Rahu-Venus-Sun-Mars really tantamount for the significations connected for death of husband.
The chart indicates longevity of husband as middle longevity or Madhya aayu. Ase lord when signifies Bhadaka, Maraka and 6,8,12, longevity upto 33 years only. Jupiter is 12* Bhava lord. From 7* house, 6* is Virgo, 8* in Scorpio and 12* is Pisces being Bhava Lords Mercury, Mars and Jupiter respectively. Jupiter is in Ketu star and signifies Ketu. Ketu is in Saturn star. Saturn, besides badhaka lord, is occupant of 2nd house (maraca).
 

 

6* Lord Mercury is in 11 * house (Badhaka) and in Rahu star. Rahu signifies Saturn. Saturn is Bhadaka. Hence connection is established between Mercury (6*, 11*) and Saturn (badaka). 8* BhcNa. Lord is Mars, who is occupant of 1 st house (i.e., 7* for husband). Saturn being Bhadaka is also occupant of 2nd house. Hence all the houses i.e., maraca, badhaka, Moksha, 6,8,12 are connected to each other.
Besides the above 7* lord Mars signifying   lord for husband is placed in between Venus on one side and Saturn & Moon in other side. This is Papakartari yoga. Though Venus is generally treated as a benefic planet, it is placed in Revati star ruled by Mercury, who is a strong significator of 11 * house (Badhaka). Besides, Venus is maraca (02, 07) lord. Saturn and Moon are occupant of 2nd house (maraca) and they are in Sun star Kruthika. Sun is occupant of badhaka house (Aquarius).
Pap3. means malefic in nature and kartari means scissors, which effects malefic influence. Planetary position on ethe date of death of the husband is given below:

President Kennedy was shot dead on 22 Nov 1963 allegedly by Lee Harvey Oswald. The widowhood has happened in her 34* year.
Libra rising and the 07'h house falls in Taurus. Take Taurus as Lagna for her husband. Planets posited in Taurus are Jupiter and Venus. When lagna, 08* are weak and connected to Mars and 06* house, one could die in a battle or by weapon. Mars is posited in Venus star Purva in Leo and hence becomes significator of lagna and 06* house (body and injury). Venus is posited in Mars star Mrigashira. Hence Venus becomes significator of 04 (Vehicle), 12 (moskha), and 07 (maraca) houses. 08* lord is Jupiter and occupant of 08* house is Saturn. Saturn is in Ketu star, whereas Ketu is occupant of 06* house (injury). Saturn is the badhaka. Jupiter is in Moon star, while Moon is occupant of 12* house (moksha, loss in general, etc.). Jupiter is conjoined with Venus and aspects 07* house (maraca).
 

Hence it is felt that lagna, and 08* are connected to Mars, 06th house, marakca, moksha and badhka houses, which is detrimental for longevity and could contribute to violent death.


















The death of President Kennedy took place during Jacqueline's vrvo period of Moon-Jup-Saturn. Dasha lord Moon (04, 06, 12} signifies vehicle, injury and moksha. Bhukti Jupiter (01, 08, 11, 04, 12} signifies self, longevity, vehicle, moksha, etc. Antara lord Saturn (10, 11, 08, 06} signifies badhaka, longevity, injury, duty, etc.
Kennedy was killed in Dealey Plaza at Elm's Street, Dallas City in Texas State on 23 Nov 1963 by assassin's bullet while traveling in Presidential Umiousine.
 
In the next chart no.97 illustrated below, the wife of the native (born on 16 Aug 1965 at 8-10 a.m. near Calicut, Kerala, 75 E 46, 11 N 15) died in Nov 2008 due to dreaded disease, cancer.

Leo is rising in the chart. For spouse, the chart may be rotated to 07* house which falls in Aquarius. For Aquarius lagna lord Saturn is posited in lagna itself and is in the star of Jupiter, who is in 05* house. This should contribute to some good longevity. But the chart should be analysed deeply. 06* house falls in Cancer, whose lord is Moon. Moon is posited in Saturn star, Utharabhadra. This indicates that 06th lord Moon becomes a strong significator of 1st
 


house (body). Hence there is a link established between 1st house (body) and 06* house (roga). Saturn, Moon and Rahu shall contribute to cancer. Rahu is posited in Rohini star ruled by Moon. Being a Node, Rahu will give result of Venus, Moon and Mars (in this chart) wherever they are offering results.
The spouse died in November 2008 during the native's VMD period of Venus-Jupiter-Moon. Venus is badhka for Aquarius and is posited in 08* house-longevity. 08* house also makes the illness serious in nature. Venus also signifies 06* house through Sun-disease. Bhukti lord Jupiter is in 05* house, which should negate the illness. But Jupiter is lord of 02 (marakca) and is posited in Mars star Mrigashira (Mars is in Badhaka house). Jupiter will make illness to swell. Antara lord Moon signifies self, 02 (marakca) and 06* (illness). Hence the period did not favour further recovery from illness and the spouse died.

Sanyasa Yogam or Ascetic

Marriage is for a life together till end of this life, sharing and caring each other. But if you find that the boy who married your daughter has lost interest in marital life on one fine morning, and he declares that he will take up sanyasin; what will you do?
This sort of situation brings about disappointments in marital life of couple and also for the persons connected with the family.
Hence it is extremely important to see in advance (when the marriage matching is done) to ensure that the chart is free from Ascetic yoga.
Astrologically, one combination is that if the lord of the Ascendant is deposited in the star of the planet, which is strongly connected with 3, 10, 12 houses and connected with Saturn I Kethu", then one will be an ascetic.
Chart No. 98 below given is that of Aurobino Ghose (August 15, 1872 - December 5, 1950) an Indian nationalist and freedom fighter, poet, philosopher and yogi.

Aurobindo had been engaged in yogic discipline for years, but disturbances to his progress following the events surrounding the Congress had put him in the need of consulting a yogi. After attending the Surat session of the Indian National Congress in 1907, Aurobindo met Vishnu Bhaskar Lele, a yogi, in Baroda. This meeting led him to retire for three days in seclusion where, following Lele's instruction, Aurobindo had his first major experience, called nirvana - a state of complete mental silence free of any thought or mental activity.

In this case, the lord of Ase. is Saturn. Whereas, planets posited in lagna are Sun, Moon and Mercury. Sun signifies 01, 07, and 04.
 
Moon (in Purva Bhadra star) signifies 06, 01, and 11, 02, 05through Jupiter. Mercury is lord of 05 and 08 and poslted in lagna in the star of Rahu, who signifies 04* house. Saturn is posited in Rahu star in 09* house and is exalted. These planets do not strongly get connected to 3, 10 and 12* house along with Saturn and Ketu.
But Mars is lord of 10 and 03 is posited in 12* house. Ketu is posited in Scorpio will follow Mars to give result of houses viz. 03, 10 and 12. Mars is in Shravana star ruled by Moon, who is occupant of lagna. Hence Mars gives result of 01, 06, 03, 10, 12 along with Ketu. Saturn is lord of lagna.
1O* lord Mars is in 12* house whlle 10* is occupied by Ketu, who is in Jupiter star. Jupiter more strongly signifies 05* house. Moon, being lord of 06* is posited in 01st house and signifies 05* through Jupiter. These combinations do not entail very much for one to take a job and earn a livelihood.
Paramhans was married at the age of 32 years, most probably, at the threshold of Mercury dasha. Mercury is lord of 05 and 08 and aspects 07* house. However, Mercury is in Rahu star and Rahu, is an occupant of 04* house. Moon is in lagna (being lord of 06) and aspects 07* house, makes the marriage not very much smooth and viable.

The Ase is rising in Leo in the star Purva ruled by Venus. Venus signifies 03, 10 and (12 through Moon).

Sun is posited in Rahu star Arudra. Rahu is in Moala and Moon is in Makha; both are ruled by Ketu. Rahu in 5* house is under the aspect of spiritual Saturn, which indicates worship. Sun signifies Rahu. Moon is lord of 12 and is in Ketu star. Saturn is posited in 8* lord and religious Jupiter star, Visakha.

Wealth or Dhana Yoga

There are various dhana yogas which are attributed by our ancients. Conjoining of lords of quadrants and trines should make the native wealthy during its dasha / antara I bhukti. Some sens ive points such as Indulagna, house of fortuna, etc. are being discussed by the ancients.
If House of fortuna falls in trines such as 01, OS, 09 or quadrants such as 01 , 04, 07, 10, they are good. Another view is if House of Fortuna falls in a particular house, the significance of that house gets boosted up.
Other than trine-quadrant, foruna or lndu lagna, the following aspects may also be considered for wealth factors.
a)	02nd lord is connected to 02, 06, 10 and 11.
b)	1O* lord is connected to 02, 06, 1O and 11.
c)	Well fortified 02nd house which is connected to 02nd or 1O* or 11* house.
d)	Dhanakaraka Jupiter's connection to 2nd house.
e)	When lagna lord and 5th lord are in trine, it appears that native will have high position.
f)	02nd or 11 * house should not get connected to 08 or 12* houses.
Let us examine some natal charts: The chart given below
(chart No. 101) is that of a person born in average circumstances.

The native is born in Ganeer Ase. with Moon in Purva star ruled by Venus in Leo. He had education upto high school level only. He had struggled a lot in Industrial area and mastered a technical job.
He started to do business by setting up a small industrial unit in Rahu dasha, Saturn bhukti. After initial problems, the unit started functioning well. One could observe that dasha lord Rahu signifies I\A::xJn (02), Mercury (business, 10). Bhukti lord Saturn signifies 02, 07 houses.
 

Now the native is well posited financially as well as business wise. For business take 07* house. If 10* house is connected to 07 and Mercury, then one will do business. If 02, 06, 10 and 11 are linked one will earn well during the dasha / bhukti / antara of significators of these houses.
In this case, planets who signify 02nd house are Sun, Moon, Rahu, Ketu, Jupiter and Saturn. This is a great advantage for wealth prospects.
As of 2010, he is running Jupiter dasha, Mercury Bhukti. Next dasha shall be of Saturn. Both dashas promise more wealth factors. The other important thing to be noted is the position of Moon in Venus star, who is lord of 11. Hence Moon signifies both 02 and 11 houses and neither IVloon nor Venus are linked to 08* or 12* houses.

Stars ruled by Venus are Bharani, PuNa and PuNa Ashada. Moon is in Bharani. Mars is in Purva. No planet in Purva Ashada. Nodes are conjoined with Venus and Mars.

Cancer is rising and 2nd house becomes Leo. The earnings are through business. For business, take 07* house along with 10* house. Mercury is the businessman. Saturn is lord of 07* house, is posited in 10* house in the star of Sun, who is lord of 2nd house. Mercury is in 7* house. Lord of 2nd house, Sun, is posited in Mars star (in 8* house), while Mars is lord and occupant of 10* house. Hence, business, wealth, etc. are very good.

From Moon sign (Libra), Mars is the lord of 2nd house, posited in 10* house. Mrigashira, Chitra and Dhanishta are the stars ruled by Mars. But there are no planets in its stars. Jupiter aspects 2nd house. Sun is the lone planet posited in Dhanakaraka Jupiter star.

Let us assume the lagna is Cancer only, because there are atleast 2 charts in circulation as far as Mr. Gates is concerned.
Ketu is occupant of 11th in Mars star Mrigashira. -11
 
Ketu is in the star of Mars, who is Lord of 10 Jupiter is in 2nd house in star of Ketu.

From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He aggressively broadened the company's range of products. Ketu dasha started in 1975 and Venus dasha started in 1982.
The following may also be looked into:
1)	Under above combination, Jupiter and Venus are connected to 2nd house.
2)	Trine of planets such as Atmakraka and Putrakaraka (Saturn and Sun in this case).
3)	L.agna and 10th house getting boosted up, etc.
4)	Venus and Saturn are in trine in 11* house.
Bill Gates became rich during Ketu & Venus Maha dasa. Ketu is posited in 11* house (gains), which is Venus House, while Jupiter is posited in 2nd house in Leo in Makha star ruled by Ketu.
So Ketu does not spoil everything as believed generally by many students. Being Node, Ketu, gives good result, unlike many astrologers claim. So Ketu gave richness in fact through Jupiter

and Venus.
For high positions, one could take Aadhi Yoga, which constitutes when benefics in 6*, 7* & 8* from Moon are present in a chart. In this chart, Moon is in Pisces.
 
Counting therefrom, 06, 07 and 08* are posited by major planets conferring Chandra Aadhyi yoga for the native to reach high level.
Fa- profession, take 10. For business take 7 and Mercury. If 7 and Mercury is connected to IO and Mercury, one should do business.
 


For Bill Gates, 10th lord is Mars. Mars is conjoined with Mercury. Mercury is in Mars star, Chitra. So Mercury is linked to 10* house.
Maha Rajah Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar of Mysore

Dhana sthana or house of wealth is deciphered from 2na house in a chart. Astrologers normally take 02, 06, 10 and 11 houses for wealth factors. Jupiter is the planet who signifies dhana or wealth.
In this case, lord of 2nd house is Sun, who rules Krithika, Uthara and Utharashada stars. Mercury is posited in Krithika.
Occupant of 02nd house is Mars, who rules Mrigashira, Chitra and Dhanishta stars. Moon and Rahu are posited in Chitra star in Libra and Virgo respectively. Ketu is posited in Mercury star Revati.
Hence the planets, who signify 02nd house are: Sun, Mercury, Mars, Moon, Rahu and Ketu.
From Moon sign, Mars becomes lord of 02nd house. Rahu and Moon are in Mars star. Ketu is aspected by Mars by its 08* aspect. Hence Moon, Mars, Rahu and Ketu do signify 02nd house from Moon sign viz. Libra. Jupiter aspects 02nd house from Moon sign.
It will be interesting to see that out of the above planets, who signify 02nd house, Sun and Mercury are posited in 11 * house from lagna. From Moon sign, 2nd lord Mars is posited in 11 * house.
11 * lord Venus signifies 06* house, since being in Jupiter star. Saturn is posited in 11 * house. 10* lord Mars is posited in 02nd house.
More importantly, the conjunction of Jupiter and Venus for Cancer Ase in lagna is considered a special high level status.
These combinations made Maharajah Krishanraja Wodeyar to be extremely rich.

Charity or Spendthrift

One of the pillars of marital life is financial stability. Normally astrologers check the financial stability, but what about charity?
When one partner spends most of the money on charity and sell away the wealth, what the other will do? This case becomes very grave and chronic in nature, when you are blessed with your descendants.
Who are the real owners of your property? In my opinion, your legal heirs who own it practically and not you. So, preserve your wealth for them.
When the 11* house which stands for gains is somehow connected to 12* house (expenses), native is found to be having no control over spending. But if Jupiter and Moon are in trine (1,5,9) to each other, the over-spending is found to be curtailed.
Let us study some of the charts having planetary combination for over spending or charity:-
Standard nativity (female), born on 23 Dec 1966 at 7.00 am near Cochin. (Chart no. 109).

In the chart drawn above, readers may mark the aspect of 12* lord Mars on 11 * lord Venus in Ascendant (Sagittarius) and 2nd lord Saturn. 11 * lord is for gains while 12* lord is for expenses. 2nd house stands for finance.
While assuming the situation from Moon sign, 11 * lord Saturn gets the aspect of 12* lord Jupiter. Besides, Saturn is imbibed in 12* in Jupiter star. 2nd lord Venus is aspected by Saturn from 12* house. Although the person is not much into charity, the spending pattern is enormous, which could cause opposition from the spouse.
2nd house signifies wealth, while 12* house stands for expenses. From lagna, 02nd house is Capricorn, which is vacant. Its lord Saturn is in Jupiter star, while Jupiter is posited in 08* house. Saturn is also aspected by Mars, who is lord of 05 and 12. Mars is posited in Moon star, who signifies 08 and 05. 5 stands for gain of opposite party (07) while 08 stands for wealth of opposite party (2nd from 07* house).
In the chart (No. 11O} drawn below belongs to Late M.S. Subbulakshmi, Bharat Ratna. The native was born on Sept 16, 1916 at9-30 a.m. in Madurai, South India. Moon star lord is Bharani, ruled by Venus. Lagna falls in Rahu star Swati in Libra.

MS was bestowed with enormous prize money and awards, which she donated to charity. She has given more than 200 charity concerts, and raised well over Crores of Rupees, to be given away in charity.
09* house signifies charity and if it has got connection to 02, 11 and 12, one could give away money in charty.
11 * lord is Sun, who is posited in own star, but in 12* house.
There are no occupants in 11 * house. Rahu is only in Sun star.
M.S. Subbulakshmi
Lord of 02 is Mars. There are no occupants in 02nd house. Mars is posited in Rahu star, while Rahu is in Sun star. Sun is in 12* house.
Mercury is the only planet posited in Mars star (Chitra). Mercury is in 12* house, being lord of 09 and 12*. Hence
Mercury signifies 02, 09 and 12. Sun (11 * lord) and Mercury are conjoined in 12* house.
In any case when 11 * lord is 12* house, one could give away money to others.
These combinations made the native to give away money earned in charity.
It is not sure whether this kind of act of charity has caused any rift in her life, but in normal circumstances, the bond of family could hamper its smoothness, since the money is required for one's upliftment in life.

In this chart, 12* house is vacant. Its lord is Mercury, who is posited in own star in 05* house. Moon is posited in 11* house and is aspected by Mercury, who is lord of 12* house. Hence there is a link established between 11 * and 12* houses. Here Mercury's placement in own star is important, since it is very strong.
 

The person is found to be not at all careful about spending matters and is alleged to have wasted money, which has caused a lot of rift in marital life.
Astrologers are required to check these kinds of combinations in natal chart at the time of evaluating marital match,so that peace and tranquility is maintained in domestic life.

Profession
Professional matters are very important now-a-days. In olden times agriculture and trading were the main sources of income for some communities while some were very rich not worrying too much into professional matters.
Now-a-days necessity of job and higher income is increasing and people are looking for alliance for their children with better professional positions.
6* house signifies service while 10* house signifies profession. Jupiter is dhana-karaka. 2nd is the house of wealth. Jupiter and Mars connection will give high level job along with 10* house.
A well placed Jupiter and 2nd lord will give very good wealth when connected to 02, 06, 10, and 11 * houses. Well placed 6* house and 10* house should make the person climb the stairs of the career-ladder. Placement of Jupiter in 6* or 10* house should also make person higher job. One will command power, if Mars is connected to 10* house.

Jupiter is in 10* house from lagna and is in Mars star, while Jupiter also gets aspect of Mars from 07* house. Jupiter stands for expansion while Mars stands for power. Other combination is to be seen is that lagna lord Saturn and 5* lord Venus are in trine. The native is bound to shine at professional matters. Native was born in Sun VMD, and around 40 years of age, he will have commencement of Jupiter VMD.
Jupiter is lord of 03 and 12 houses, and is posited in 10* house in Chitra star ruled by Mars. Mars is lord of 04 and 11 and is posited in 07* house. Jupiter aspects 2nd house also. Hence Jupiter signifies 03, 12, 04, 11, 07, and 10 (and aspects 02 and 06). Hence during \/MD of Jupiter, native will prosper financially and get high positions in Professional front, but will have change of jobs, etc.
There are powerful planets like Sun, Mercury, 1\/lars and Venus in 06, 07, 08 from lagna, conferring the native with lagna Aadhi yoga. This will also contribute the native to reach high level in life.

The chart could be evaluated for profession. Cancer rising, and yogakaraka Mars who is lord of 5* and 10* is placed in own house and hence is well placed. From the Ase, 6* lord Juptter is in own house and is well placed. From the Moon sign, 10* lord Jupiter is placed in own house. Venus and Saturn are in trine in the house of wealth, duly apsected by dhana karaka Jupiter. These combinations are really good for a high level professional career and extremely rich wealth factors.
In the chart no. 114 exampled below, native joined a Public Sector undertaking as a junior level Assistant, but climbed the ladder of his career gradually, and rose to the level of avery senior position.

The career is seen from 10* house, which in this case, falls in Virgo. Its lord is Mercury. No planet is in Mercury star. Jupiter is the occupant of 10* house. No planet is in Jupiter stars. Occupant is stronger. Planets who are aspecting 10* house is only Mars from 04* house. Hence Mercury, Jupiter and Mars are significators of 10* house without being connected to 08* or 12* houses. (Of course, Mars is lord of 12* house).
In the periods of Jupiter-Jupiter and Jupiter-Saturn, the native completed his graduation. He got regular promotions since Jupiter VMD. In Saturn VMD, he rose to senior level authority. Saturn is lord of 02 and 03 houses, but is posited in own star in 12* house. More than this, Saturn becomes yogakaraka for Taurus sign as well as lord of 10* house from Moon sign, has helped the native.
Since Mars is posited in Saturn star, Uthara Bhadra and Saturn is lord of 03rd house (subordinate), the joining of native at subordinate level was caused. The career growth was gradual due to Mars imbibing in Saturn's star, Uthara Bhadra. Saturn is slow, signals lower levels, struggles and hardwork.
 

Mars gave gradual power, authority and one's ability to command, while Jupiter gave sound judgement, administrative skills, wise decision taking capacity and expansion.
Other combination to be noted is the conjunction of Saturn and Venus. In the period of yogakaraka Saturn, the efficacy of this combination took its full form.
In the chart no. 115 mentioned below, the native got elevated in professional front to the level of a Manager in a famous multi national Company.

From lagna, 1O* house is posited by Mars, Mercury and Venus. 1O* lord is Sun, in whose star, Jupiter is posited. From rvloon sign, 1O* house falls in Scorpio. There are no occupants of Scorpio, but Jupiter aspects. Mars is the lord, as well as aspecting. These are good combinations for elevation in career. But 1O* house is posited
 

by 12* lord Venus and 08* lord Mercury. These combinations make situation difficult for him, and the native undergoes uneasy relationship from superiors as well as subordinates. During Mercury-Dasha, Ketu Bhukti (Ketu is aspected by Saturn), the native had to face some difficult times at office, and eventually had to put in his papers.
Venus signifies I.T. sector. Mercury and Mars are conjoined in 1O* house signals a job related to analysis. Jupiter will signify finance. Native was employed in Finance Section in an I.T. Company and was involved in financial analytical work.
Unemployment
News of a promising career for the prospective son-in-law shall glitter the eyes of his father-in-law, there are cases when there is no job or career for the son-in-law, which could be disappointing news.
At the time of matching the horoscope of the girl and boy, do astrologers check as to whether the career of the boy is promising? Pragmatically, many do not check this point.
It is indeed quite necessary to evaluate as to whether one will have a good career or not for any astrologer at the time of marriage matching.
When 10* house is connected to 03, 08, 12, 05, 09 and Ketu, one may find very difficult to obtain a job for a livelihood. 03rd house stands for change of place and sub-ordinate position. 08* stands for disappointments, difficulties, humiliation, etc. 12* house is generally considered as loss in general. 05* house stands for negation to service (06). 09* is for negation to 10* (profession).

In this chart, Sagittarius is rising at 13 deg. 37 min. in Moola star ruled by Ketu. 10* house falls in Virgo ruled by Mercury. Planets posited in Mercury stars (Aslesha, Jyeshta, Revati) are none. Merrury is posited in 08* house. Nodes connected to Mercury are Rahu and Ketu. Ketu is an aborting or exiting node. Rahu is posited in 2nd house in Moon star, who is lord of 08* house.
 

Saturn is posited in 10* house in Chitra star ruled by Mars. Planets postted in Saturn star (Pushya, Anurada, Uthara Bhadra) are Mercury and Ketu. Since Mercury is aspecting Rahu, it will give result of 10* house. Saturn's star lord Mars signifies 07, 05, 12 houses. Besides, Mars aspects 10* house. Mars is posited in Rahu star, while Rahu signifies Moon (08}.
Although Mars's position on 07* house and aspecting 1O* house is normally treated as good combination, because of the significations of Mars (05, 12, 08), it did not auger well. Ketu's connection with 10* house has to be viewed seriously, since it could hamper the continuance of one's career.
From Moon sign (Libra), 10* house falls in Cancer, which is inhabited by Mercury (09,12) and the exiting Node Ketu. Moon herse  is the lord of 10* house. Moon is in Jupiter star Visakha, while Jupiter signifies 03, 06, 08.
In effect, these combinations did not go well with him for a career.
The person finally attempted to do some business in Mercury dasha, Saturn bhukti, but did not meet with success. Mercury (business) and Saturn are signifcators of 07 and 10 indicating business and profession.
By the onset of Ketu dasha (07 years) from 2000 to 2007 and further in the Venus dasha (occupant of 05), he did not do any specific job.
Will I Get a Working Woman as My Wife?
In ancient times, women normally do not come out their house to seek out a livelihood. They manage their home and take care of the household chores. Now-a-days many women are well educated and they do seek an employment at the first instance.
Many boys prefer working woman as their life partner. An educated and employed woman brings increased standard of living in the society and controls the population.
But some women are still staying at home.
 
The chart shown hereunder belongs to a decently educated woman born and brought up in a major city in India. Unfortunately, she is a house-wife, although wishes to take up a job. She was born on Jan 29, 1960 at 00-30 hours, Hyderabad, India. (Chart no. 117).

Moon is posited in Capricorn. Counting there-from, 10* house shall be Libra. There are no occupants of 10* house. Venus is the lord of it, is pos ed in 12* house. Venus is posited in the star of Ketu, who makes one exit from its signification allocated.
 

Dasha running during the time of the native attaining the age of job shall be of Rahu. Rahu is posited in 12* house and signifies Mera.iry (04, 09, 10, 12), Saturn and Sun (11, 04, 10,). Saturn is lord of 04 and 05 in 3rd house, in the star of Venus, who signifies 01, 03, 08. Hence detrimental houses have come into picture during Rahudasha.
Next dasha of Jupiter ran upto 2002. Jupiter is definitely lord of 06 (service), but is posited Moala star ruled by Ketu star. Hence Jupiter will give the result of Ketu, who is an exiting-type Node.
Next dasha is of Saturn. The significations of Saturn have been discussed. Although, Saturn is the yogakaraka for Libra, it cannot offer a good employment because of its significations viz, 03, 04, 05 Ve» 03, 08, 01. Hence the native remained jobless and contented her life as house-wife.
In yet another chart no. 118 appended below of a married woman, but she is jobless for the last 23 years. In other words, she is a house-wife.

Lagna falls in Sagittarius. 1O* house shall be in Virgo. Mars is occupant of 1O* house, being lord of 05 (negation to 06-sei:vfce) and 12* (loss) houses. Mars is in the star of Moon, who is lord of 08* (disappointment and difficulties) is posited in 05* house
 


(negation to 06). Occupant Mars gets the aspect of Saturn, who signifies detrimental houses like 03 and 08.
10* lord is Mercury, who is posited in 12* (loss) house and is in own star.
Moon sign is in Aries. Counting from Aries, 10* house falls in Capricorn. Its lord is Saturn, who is posited in 11 * bhava and in 12* house in the star of Jupiter, who is lord of 08 and 12. Jupiter is posited in 03rd bhava in 04 * house in Saturn star. Jupiter aspects Saturn. Mars is aspecting Saturn, being lord of 01 and 08 in 06* bhava.
Hence both from lagna and Moon sign, the 10* house has got negative connection like 05, 09, besides detrimental houses like 03, 08, 12 for one not to get a job.
The marriage took place in Sun-Sun period. Sun is lord of 09, occupant of 1st house (12* bhava) and is in the star of Ketu, who signifies 11 * house. Sun ran upto 27* year.
Next dasha shall be of Moon, which runs from 27* to 37* year. Moon is occupant of 05* house, being lord of 08* house. Moon is in the star (Ashwini) of aborting or exiting node Ketu.
Next dasha shall be of Mars which runs from 37* year to 44* year. Mars is of course occupant of 10* bhava. But Mars signifies OS, 12, 08 and 12 and is under aspect of Saturn.
Next dasha shall be of Rahu for next 18 years, who is occupant of 05 (negation to 6--service),
Since the significations of planets connected to 10* house and the dasha ran do not favour for a job, the native stayed at home as housewife.
Following chart no. 119 is of a woman with average education, but somehow found a Government job.

From lagna, which falls in Taurus, 10* lord is Saturn, who is posited in 06* house. But Saturn is in the star of Rahu, who signifies 08, 11 and 03. 03rd lord Moon is occupant of 1 0* house and is in the star of Jupiter, who signifies 03, 08, 11 . Moon gets the aspect of Sun who signifies 06* house through Venus.
 

 

Since 03 ·and 08 are connected, the job shall be at a lower level. 10* house is comparatively stronger due to connection of Saturn, Moon, Sun and 11 * house.
From Moon sign, Mars becomes lord of 10* house, who is posited in Venus star, who is in Rahu star. Of course, 09* house is connected through Venus. Rahu is occupant of 11 * house along with Mars. Hence 10* is connected to 1 1 * and not connected to Ketu. This has helped to get a job.
However, husband of this woman has no job for a long time. Counting from 07* house, which falls in Scorpio, 10* house shall be in Leo. Profession is seen from 10* house. It is occupied by its lord Sun. This should warrant a job for her husband. But it is not so. A little deeper study of the chart should reveal more stunning results viz:
a)	Sun, being 10* lord is in the star of Venus, who is lord and occupant of 12* house. Hence 10* house is linked to 12* house.
b)	Sun is aspected by Moon, who is lord of 09* house, which negates profession.
c)	Moon is posited in the star of Jupiter, who is lord of 05 (negation to service - 6* house) and Jupiter is posited in own star in 09* house. 09* house negation job (10* house).
d)	Lord of 06* house is Mars (Service). Mars aspects Ketu. Hence Ketu will give result of 08 (occupancy) and 06* (service). Ketu will be forcing one to exit from its significations.
e)	Mars, lord of 06* house - service, is further aspected by Saturn from 1 2* house. Saturn is lord of 03rd house.
All these combinations made her husband not to have a continuous job and she has been made to support the family.
 


The chart no. 120 mentioned below, is of a housewife, born on 05 Nov 1954 at 4-00 a.m. 1ST, Tiruvalla, near Kottayam, Kerala, India, 76E34, 09N23:

In this chart, Virgo lagna rising and 10* house falls in Gemini ruled by Mercury. There are no planets posited in Mercury stars. Only Ketu signifies Mercury and 10* house. Occupant is stronger. Ketu is having the tendency for "show-nothing" since it is an exiting type Node. 1O* lord Mercury is in 2nd house, which is nom1ally treated as a good combination, considering the wealth factors generated by 2nd house. But Mercury is posrred in the star Chrrra
 


ruled by Mars. Mars is lord of 03 and 08 and is posited in 05* house.
IVloon is in Aquarius. From Moon sign, 10* house is occupied by Venus, who is in Anurada star ruled by Saturn, VVro is lord of 12, posited in 09* house. 10* and 03rd lord Mars is posited in 12* house and is in own star, being strong to negate job prospects.
These combinations rendered no job for the native, and she remained as house-wife in her life of 56 years upto now.
Toe following chart no. 121 belongs to a housewife, born on 30 July 1971 at 00-50 hours IST, Near Kottayam, Kerala, India.

Aries rising and 10* lord shall be Saturn. Saturn is in 2nct house and is under aspect of Jupiter from 08* house, who is lord of 09 and 12. Jupiter is in own star.
10* house is occupied by Mars and Rahu. Mars is lord of 01 and 08. Rahu will give the result of Mars (01, 08), Venus (02, 07),
Sun (04, 05, 10, 11), Moon (03, 07, 08, 01, 10) and Saturn (03,
10,11,07).
Rahu is somewhat favourable, but Saturn did not really get the strength to offer a job for her. Since Mars aspects Ketu, Ketu will give the result of 10* house. Hence Jupiter, Mars and Ketu spoiled the 10* house by virtue of thier significations.

Disease & Illness
There are several types of diseases, which are prevalent right from ancient times.
But in the modern society the common diseases are diabetes, heart disease and Cancer.
Illness or disease is prevalent only when lagna (body) and 06* house (disease) are connected. 08* house denotes gravity of disease or suddenness, while 12* signifies hospitalization. Saturn, Rahu and Jupiter are slow moving planets, who will inflict chronic nature of disease.
Diabetes
Diabetes mellitus is often simply referred to as diabetes, is a condition in which a person has a high blood sugar (glucose) level as a result of the body either not producing enough insulin, or because body cells do not properly respond to the insulin that is produced. Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas, which enables body cells to absorb glucose, to turn into energy. If the body cells do not absorb the glucose, the glucose accumulates in the blood (hyperglycemia), leading to various potential medical complications.
The pancreas is a gland organ in the digestive and endocrine system of vertebrates. It is both an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin, as well as an exocrine gland, secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that pass to the small intestine. These enzymes help in the further breakdown of the carbohydrates, protein, and fat in the chyme.
 
Moon, Venus and Jupiter when connected with 6* lord, Saturn or Rahu and in some cases Mars, and any of these planets are connected to Ase. and a watery sign, then the native can be declared as a diabetic patient. (Chart below No. 122)

Ra:	15S(117-PiK	Ke:	15Ge17	HL:	Ha05 •	GL:	.	0Ar22
In this case, Ase. falls in the star of Moon in Rohini in Taurus, whereas Moon is occupant of 06* house. Hence there is a relation between Ase. and Moon. Lagna and 06* lord Venus is conjoined with Saturn.
Mars is aspecting lagna and 06* lord Venus from a watery sign, Pis:::es and Jupiter star Purva Bhadrapada. Mars signifies blood. Mars is also aspecting Moon who is in 06* house. Jupiter aspects lagna, who is a significator of 06* house through Moon, since pos ed in Shravana star ruled by Moon. Jupiter is lord of 08* house.
Venus is signifying lagna and 06* house, who is conjoined with Saturn. Saturn is connected to 12* house through Mars. Saturn is normally treated as a malefic planet in nature and a significator of defects. Diabetes is a defect of the pancreas glands, which produces insulin.
In the chart mentioned below (Chart No. 42), the native, born on 02 Sep 1961 at 9-18 a.m. Cochin, Kerala, with balance rvloon dasha upto April 1965. (Chart No. 123):

He was diagnosed with diabetes in Jupiter-Venus period. L..agna
 
lord and 08* lord Venus (posted in cancer) is aspected by Jupiter and Saturn. Jupiter is lord of 06*, while Saturn aspects 06* house. Moon is in 08* house while Mars is in 12* house in Moon star and hence signifies 08* house. Mars is also aspecting 06* house.
Cancer
Cancer is a dass of disease in which a group of cells display uncontrolled growth (division beyond the normal limits), invasion (intrusion on and destruction of adjacent tissues), and sometimes metastasis (spread to other locations in the body via lymph or blood). These three malignant properties of cancers differentiate them from benign tumors, which are self-limited, and do not invade or metastasize. Most cancers form a tumor but some, like leukemia, do not. The branch of medicine concerned with the study, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer is oncology.
cancer affects people at all ages with the risk for most types increasing with age. Cancer caused about 13% of all human deaths in 2007 (7.6 million).
Cancers are caused by abnormalities in the genetic material of the transformed cells. These abnormalities may be due to the effects of carcinogens, such as tobacco smoke, radiation, chemicals, or infectious agents. Other cancer-promoting genetic abnormalities may randomly occur through errors in DNA replication, or are
 


inherited, and thus present in all cells from birth. The heritability of cancers is usually affected by complex interactions between carcinogens and the host's genome.
Illness take place only when lagna (body) and 06* house (raga sthana) are linked. Saturn, Rahu and Moon are the main culprits to cause the dreaded disease, cancer.







Brain cancer	Brain tumour
The question of cancer disease comes when Saturn, Moon and Rahu are connected to lagna. The chart below given Chart No. 124, is that of a person who died of cancer in November 2008.

Dasha lord Jupiter and Bhukti lord Saturn signifies 08 (serious nature). 08* lord Mercury signifies 2 = maraca and 9 = badhaka. Dasha lord Jupiter signifies 02 and 09 (maraca and badhaka). Bhukti lord Saturn gets aspect of Jupiter. Besides Saturn is in the star of Mercury who signifies 09 (badhaka). Antara lord Moon signifies badhaka and maraca. Hence native passed away during Jup-Sat-Mon period in November 2008 itself.

The part afflicted is brain, which is signified by Mars and Sun along with planets who srgnify either lagna or Aries. Antara lord Moon is in Sun star. 06* house falls in Aries ruled by Mars, who aspects Aries from Rahu star, while Rahu, the lead planet for cancer is posited in Aries.

Now, there should a connection between Aquarius (lagna) and Cancer (06-roga). Readers may mark the position of Saturn in Moon star Hasta in 08* house in Virgo (not bhava). Indeed, Saturn is conjoined with Moon in Virgo. Hence Saturn alone will give the result of lagna and raga sthan resulting in raga for his son.
Further, Ase star lord is Rahu, while 06* star lord is Mercury. Indeed Mercury is posited in Rahu star and hence Mercury becomes a significator of lagna and 06* house, thereby establishing once again the aspect of raga for the native.
Saturn is further aspected by Jupiter from a watery sign - Pisces, who passes on phlegm. 03rd house is signified by Mars being lord of Aries. Mars aspects Rahu, who signifies lagna and Saturn. Hence Rahu gives the result of 03rd house, Saturn, lagna and 06* house. Rahu is a posited in an airy sign (Aquarius). Airy signs contributes dust allergy.
 


Mercury is another planet, who signifies lungs, is in Rahu star Swati and posited in an airy sign {Libra). Hence wherever Rahu gives its results, Mercury also will give.
Saturn is the planet which creates difficulty while breathing close to 08* bhava and being lord of 12* house signifies serious nature of illness and hospitalization.
So, 01 {lagna), 06 {roga), 03rd house {lungs), 08* house (serious nature), 12* house {hospitalization), Mercury {lungs) airy sign (dust), Saturn (difficulty in breathing), Mars (03rdhouse), Rahu (agent of Saturn and Mars) have come into picture for breathing difficulties and phlegm formation in lungs for this boy.
Recovery is seen from 01, 05 and 11 * houses only. Planet signifying 05* house is only Mercury. Lagna is signified by Saturn, Rahu, Mercury and Sun. Jupiter alone signifies 11 * house. But unfortunately, these planets do also signify roga houses. Hence the illness shall recur whenever dasha I bhukti antara signifies 01 and 06.
The chart of father is a telling example to see the illness aspect of his son.

Misfortunes

There are numerous mishaps in life, like attack of chronic illness like Cancer, or accidents, divorces, early death of spouse, etc.
Astrologer is required to check these aspects carefully. Let us take few examples for these mishaps.
Accidents
Accidents, accidental deaths and misfortunes should be co-related with the longevity of the native at the time of marriage matching. Sarvatha Chintamani by Venkatesh Sarma, vide Chapter 8 stanza 26 says that-
-if the Ase and 8* are devoid of strength, and are afflicted by Mars and 6* lord, the native dies in a battle or by a weapon.
The Author has tested this particular rule in the horoscope of around 40 nativities lived in this world right from the mythological period to the modern era of 21 st century AD who died tragically. The rule is found to be correct by 100%.
Whenever Mars is connected to Ase, (body), 06 (injury), 08 (Accident) there are chances that the native shall meet with accidents, if the transits agree.
 
Case No.140-Swapna, Born June 17, 1962 at 5.30 a.m. at Mumbai, India, is of a female nativity, had met with a road accident and was severely injured.

The Psi:, lord Venus gets the aspect of planet of accident, Mars (from 12* house). Mars also aspects 6* house (cuts and wounds) owned by Venus. Sun, who is placed in Mars star Mrigashira, is aspecting 8* house (house of suddenness, danger and accidents), while the fl&, has got some sort of Pai:a kartari yoga with Mars and Sun on either side. A well-placed Jupiter's aspect (though 8* lord) has saved the native, since Jupiter (lord of 11*) is aspecting the 6* house (house of cuts and wounds) as well as Sun, who signifies Mars. 5* lord Mercury's position in lagna is also important for life saving in this case.
The accident took place on Sept 14, 1986during Venus-Venus-Merrury period. It was also during Sade-sath period. On the day of accident, Mars was in 8* house, while Venus was in 6* house and Jupiter was aspecting Venus.

President Reagan was shot at on March 30, 1981. A long-nosed .22 caliber bullet, fired from a pistol, ricocheted off the Presidential limousine and entered Reagan's chest, under his left arm. The bullet was of exploding type, but it did not explode. The main threat to Reagan's life was from blood loss and a collapsed lung, but the President survived.
President Reagan completed his term in office and eventually died on 5-Jun-2004 due to Alzheimer's disease and pneumonia at the age of 93 in Los Angeles, California.
M£ lord Jupiter is in 11thhouse. 5* lord Mars is posited in lagna. 8* lord Moon is in 5* with Saturn and Rahu, but
 
President Reagan
 
unaspected by Mars, whereas Mars aspects 8* house. 06* lord Venus is in Rahu star, whereas Rahu in Aries will signify Mars, the planet of injury. Moon
(08) is in Venus star (06) and aspects lagna lord Jupiter.
 

8* lord Moon is in 5* house and is aspected by fasc lord Jupiter. Since 8* lord got beneficial Jupiter aspect, and fasc lord Jupiter was neither aspected by Mars or 6* lord Venus, President Reagan survived the attempt on this life.
Since 06* lord Venus is in 3rd house (shoulders, lungs), the bullet fired hit the part under left arm and lung was injured.
The period of injury was commensurate with Sat-Mer-Ven-Mer. Saturn is lord of 3 (shoulders, lungs, etc.}, Mercury is in fasc (self)/ Venus is in 3rd house, being lord of 06 (injury). Mercury is conjoined with Mars. Rahu signifies Mars. Mars aspects 4* house - vehicle. Rahu signifies 06* through Venus, has caused injury during the above period while traveling in Presidential limousine.
The native, whose birth data are given below (Chart 142),
had met with two vehicular accidents:
Birth data is: 9th of July 1969 Luanda, Angola, Time of birth

Accident 1: 1st of Dec. 2008 nearTralee, Ireland at 08.00 AM, Accident 2: 4th of March 2010 near Ballyduff, Ireland at 19.15 (approx.)
First of all, does the chart speak of accidents or not?
For accidents, take 01, 06, 08 and Mars. For vehicular accident, take 04 * and Venus. If 12* is connected, one will be in hospital, Accidents are always caused by Mars. For recovery, take O1, 05 and 11.
01 or Ase stands for self. 06 is the house of injury, while Mars signifies injury. 08* house is for accidents. 12* house stands for hospitalization. Accident will take place during the conjoined period of planets signifying O1, 06, and 08 along with Mars when transits agree. If the period at the time of accident and during hospitalisation also involves houses like 01, 05 or 11, there will be recovery. If this period does not get connected to O1, 05 or 11, but gets connected to 06, 08 and 12 along with maraca and badhaka, it should be signaled by Astrologer as a dangerous period.
In the chart under consideration, Saturn is lord of 01st house (lagna) and signifies O1, 02, 04, Ve» 05, 10, 05. Lagna falls in the
star of Sun (Uthara Ashada). Sun signifies 08, 06, Ju» 12, 03, 09. Sun gets the aspect·of Mars. Hence houses O1, 06, 08 and Mars are connected. Venus also gets aspect of Mars. This indicates that the native will meet with vehicular accidents in his life, when the pertinent dasha, bhukti and antara operate along with transits.
One Accident took place on 01-Dec-2008 near Tralee, Ireland at 08.00 a.m., during Jup-Jup-Jup-Ven VMD period. Jupiter signifies houses 03, 12, 09, Su» 08, 06. As we have already seen Sun signifies 01, 06, 08 and is aspected by Mars. Hence the star lord of Jupiter is very well connected to O1, 06, 08 and Mars to give accidents. Sookshma lord Venus also gets aspect of Mars. Venus signifies vehicles and is posited in Sun star, Krithika. Since Jupiter signifies 12* house, the native should have been hospitalized.

The Ase is in Libra. L.agna lord and 08* lord (longevity), Venus, is posited in lagna, and is aspected by Jupiter being lord of 06* (injury). Mars (planet of injury) is conjoined in lagna (self) and aspects 06* lord (injury) Jupiter. Lagna is in between Saturn and Sun on both the sides.
These combinations entail lagna and the 8* house weak, and are connected to Mars as well as 06 * house caused injury by weaj'.X)n (Mars).
Dasha lord Jupiter is in Aries (fiery sign) - 7th (maraca) and is in the star of Sun (badhka and moksha). Bhukti lord Ketu is in 04 * house, will signify Saturn, Mars, Moon.

Antara lord Mercury is also connected to self and 12, is conjoined with 02nd and 07* (maraca) lord Mars. Hence the period favoured eventual departure from this world.
04 * house signifies Public. Bhukti lord Ketu is in 4* house. 3rd house always signifies arms. Hence 3rd house of a person from public shall be 06* house. 06* house is vacant. Its lord is Jupiter. Jupiter is aspecting lagna and lagna lord. Jupiter is a Brahmin. Nathuram Goclse was a Brahmin by birth. Mars signifies young

Suicides
Vincent Van Gogh, born on 30 Mar 1853 at 11-00 am Zundert, Netherlands (30 March 185.'.3-29July 1890) was a painter whose work had a far-reaching influence on 20th century art for its vivid colors and emotional impact. He suffered from anxiety and increasingly frequent bouts of mental illness throughout his life, and died largely unknown, at the age of 37, from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
Little appreciated during his lifetime, his fame grew in the years after his death. Today, he is widely regarded as one of history's greatest painters and an important contributor to the foundations of modern art. Van Gogh did not begin painting until his late twenties, and most of his best-known works were produced during his final two years. He produced more than 2,000 artworks, consisting of around 900 paintings and 1,100 drawings and sketches. Although he was little known during his lifetime, his work was a strong influence on the Modernist art that followed. Today many of his pieces-including his numerous self portraits, landscapes, portraits and sunflowers-are among the world's most recognizable and expensive works of art.
At the time of his death he was a failure, a misfit who had sold only two paintings in his lifetime, an artist who was later known as one of the most famous painters of all time. Two years after his death, a Dutch museum gave him a retrospective. His tragic story first became the basis for a novel in 1907. Irving Stone's "Lust For Life" came out in 1934 and was made into a movie in 1956. In
 
1987, a collector paid close to $54 million for his "Irises," now placed in the Getty Museum in Los Angeles.
Some of the combinations for suicides are given below:
01.	Lagna is connected to 02nd, 07*, 08* houses and Badhaka lord / badhaka house.
02.	08* house is connected to Mars or Saturn and linked to houses such as 01, 06, 07, 08, 12.
03.	12* house when connected to maraca, badhaka, Mars, Rahu and O1 , 06, 08 and 12* houses.

Lagna is falling in the star of Rahu in Gemini. Rahu signifies Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.
Saturn aspects Rahu and signifies 08, 09, 11, 12and 05 houses. Rahu is in Mars star as well as Mars aspects Rahu and signifies 06, 11, 10, 08and 09 houses. Rahu will signify Mercury being in Gemini. Mercury signifies O1 , 04, 11 and Ketu (07). Jupiter aspects Rahu and signifies 07, 10, Ke (07).
Hence lagna star lord Rahu signifies 08, 09, 11, 12, 05, 06,
10, 01, 04 and 07 houses. Out of which 01 (self), 07 (maraca and badhaka), 12 (moksha), 06 (Injury), Mars - weapon and injury, etc. are prominent.
 


 












Vincent Van Gogh
 
Death took place on 29-July-1890 in VMD of Moon-Rahu-Moon by self inflicted gun shot. Dasha lord Moon is lord of 02 (maraca} is in the star of Mercury (lagna-self). Moon is in 06* house - house of injury. Mars, who is signifying injury, is aspecting lagna. Bhukti lord Rahu is posited in lagna (self) and is aspected by Jup er from 07th house (maraca and badhaka}. Being Node, Rahu gives the result of Jupiter.
On seeing the chart, one could mistake the conjunction of 08* lord Saturn is with that of lagna lord Mercury. This combination, in normal circumstances, should give good longevity. Van Gcgh took away his own life with a gun in his 37th year which obviously granted medium life.
 
Moon is in 06* house will make the native to have conflict of mind or some disorder connected to mind. Moon is in Mercury star, Jyeshta and signifies O1, 06 and 04. Star lord of Mercury is Ketu, the mokshakaraka. Mercury being lord of lagna (brain) and 04 (mind) as well as the intelligent planet who handles nerves system is conjoined with Saturn (slow). Saturn is the lord of 08 (impediments). Hence the native could suffer from some sort of nerves or mental disorder.
A maraca or badhaka planet connected to lagna or lagna lord shall be a detrimental factor for good longevity. Here maraca and badhka is Jupiter, who aspects both lagna and lagna lord.
When lagna is connected to 02, 07, 08 houses and badhaka lord/ house, one could commit suicide. Here we should take Mars also. Here 02nd lord is Moon, who is in Mercury star and hence connected to lagna. Saturn, being lord of 08 is conjoined with lagna lord and aspects lagna. Jupiter is badhaka is aspecting lagna,
 
lagna lord and 08* lord Saturn. These combinations should make one commit suicide. Mars (from Saturn star) aspects lagna.

Adolf Hitler
 
1945) was an Austrian-born German politician and the leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party (German:		Nationalsoziallstische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, abbreviated NSDAP), commonly known as the Nazi Party. He was the totalitarian leader of Germany from 1933 to 1945, seiving as chancellor from 1933 to 1945 and as	head	of state	(Fuhrer	und Reichskanz/ef)	from 1934 to 1945.
A decorated veteran of World War I, Hitler joined the Nazi Party (OAP) in 1919 and became leader of NSDAP in 1921.
 
Hitler was born on April 20, 1889 at 06-30 pm Braunau, Austria, with Libra rising at Mars star Ch ra and the Moon in Purva Ashada star in Sagittarius.
 


Lagna star lord is Mars. Mars is in 07* house at 24 deg. 10 min., which commensurate with Bharani star 4* pada. Bharani is ruled by Venus. Venus is lord of 01 and 08 and is posited in own star. Hence Mars gives the result of 01, 02, 07, and 08. Mars and Venus are conjoined with Sun in 07* house, which is a maraca house.
When the lagna and 08* house are not strong, and are connected to maraca / badhaka / moksha, the longevity of the native is threatened.
But in this case, the mutual aspect of Saturn and Mars cannot be ignored. The death took place in Rahu-Sun-Moon period.
Dasha lord Rahu is posited in Gemini in Punarvasu star ruled by Jupiter. Jupiter is also aspecting Rahu. Hence Rahu will give result of Mercury (07, 09, 12, Ke) and Jupiter -in Purva Ashada star- (03, 06, 01, 07 and 08), Bhukti lord Sun is in Ketu star and signifies 11, 07and Ketu. Antara lord Moon is in Purva Ashada star and signifies 10, 03, 01, 08 and 07.
Hence the houses connected are 01 (self), 3 (hands), 06 (injury), 07 (maraca), 08 (longevity), 11 (Badhaka), 12 (Moksha), Mars (weapon and injury) and Ketu {Mokshakaraka) become prominent.
When 08th house is connected to Mar or Saturn and they are linked to houses such as 01,06,07,08 and 12, one could commit suicide.
Here 08* lord is Venus, who is conjoined with 07* lord Mars in 07* house. Venus is connected to 01 (lagna lord), aspected by Jupiter (06), Venus herself is 08* lord. Venus is further conjoined with Mercury (12*).

Imprisonment or Jail Yoga
Is the person with whom you are finalizing your marital life,
has got any prison yoga as seen in the following charts?
In Vedic method, the definition of imprisonment is that if the lord of Lagna and the 6th join a kendra or trikona with Saturn, Rahu or Ketu, the al:x:lve yoga is given raise to. If Rahu becomes a significator of lagna and 12* house, this yoga is obseNed. If planets like Saturn, Mars, Sun, Rahu and Ketu signify both 2nd or 08* or 12* house, imprisonment is seen. Houses 03, 08, and 12 shall contribute for restriction in movement or away from home in a confined place.
Results is that the native will be incarcerated.
Mahatma Gandhi (Chart No. 147) was born on 02-0ct 1869 at 7-45 a.m. LMT at Porbandar, Gujarat, Western India.

Mahatma Gandhi
 
Gandhi was arrested several times during his life time by the British.
The lagna falls in Rahu star Swati, while Rahu signifies 12* house through Moon, who is in 12* lord Mercury star. Rahu is in Pushya star ruled by Saturn.
Lagna and lagna lord Venus falls in between Saturn (2nd house) and Sun (in 12* house). Saturn is posited in Mercury star, and Mercury signifies 12* house. Sun is badhaka. Lagna lord Venus is in quadrant to Nodes. 06* lord Jupiter is in quadrant to Nodes.
 
Lagna and 08* lord is Venus and is aspected by Jupiter (lord of 03). 12* lord Mercury is conjoined with Venus.
Hence the combination of 03, 08 12 are connected to lagna, paying way for restriction of movement and imprisonment.

As per this, lord of lagna, Jupiter is not in 6*, but in 7* house It is not conjoined with 6* lord nor is in Kendra or Kana to Sat• Rahu or Ketu. But 06* lord is in trine to Ketu.
But the lagna lord is posited in 7* house in Rahu sta, hemmed in between Saturn, Sun and Mercury on one side, lord of 6, Venus and Ketu on other side.
 
Rahu and 12* house will throw more nature of imprisonment. L.agna lord Jupiter is in Rahu star while Rahu is posited in 12* house. So lagna lord Jupiter is connected to Rahu and 12* house. This would definitely be a combination for imprisonment. Besides, Saturn is lord of 03rd house in 08* house. Ketu is in 06* house and signifies 12 through Mars. Jupiter is in 07* house and is in between Ketu and Saturn.

The kc falls in Mercury star, Aslesha, in Cancer while lagna lord Moon is posited in Aslesha star 1st pada. Mercury is lord of 12* house.
Rahu posited in Gemini in own star, Arudra, will also give result of Mercury, the sign lord. Hence Rahu becomes strong for 12* house (imprisonment) along with lagna. Mercury, being lord of 3 and 12, is also posited in Rahu star Swati. 06* lord Jupiter is in quadrant & trine to Ketu and is in quadrant to Rahu. 08* lord Saturn is posited in 2nd house while Rahu is posited in 12* house. These combinations really warrant life in prison.
 
Sirhan Sirhan, born on 19-Mar-1944 at 14-00 pm Sunday at Jerusalem, Israel, Latitude 31 N 47, Longitude 35 E 1O, is confined to California State Dept. jail for killing Robert Francis Kennedy, younger brother of Late US President, John F. Kennedy.
On June 5, 1968, Sirhan fired a .22 caliber Iver-Johnson Cadet revolver at Senator and Presidential candidate Robert Kennedy and the crowd surrounding him in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles shortly after Kennedy had finished addressing supporters in the hotel's main ballroom.
The natal chart no. 150 of Sirhan is given below:

The crowd surrounding Kennedy overpowered the assassin Sirhan. He was tried by the judiciary. He was awarded capital punishment, but later it was commuted to life in prison. As of 2010, Sirhan has been in jail for last 42 years since then, having denied parole 13 times.
Rahu is posited in lagna, and is conjoined wlth Jupiter who is in Mercury star. Hence Rahu is giving the result of 03,12* house through Jupiter. Rahu, a catalyst, is posited in Saturn star, Pushya.
 

Saturn is lord of 08. Rahu alone creates 03, 08, 12 results through Mercury (via Jupiter) and Saturn.
On the date of his arrest, June 05, 1968, Sirhan was running Rahu-Rahu-Mercury VMD period, clearly indicates 03, 08, 12 houses connected. He ran Rahu dasha upto 1985, Jupiter dasha upto 2001 and shall run Saturn dasha upto 2020. Since Rahu, Jupiter and Saturn-though in 11 *, signify 03, 08, 12* houses and hence do not foresee release from prison.

General Observations
There are some general, but vital points which could be kept in mind while evaluating the marriage matching.
Intelligence and Communicational Skills
The intelligence and memory skill of the spouse plays an important role in the marital life..
Ascendant and 5th house, besides Jupiter and Mercury are the points to be considered for intelligence. If the 5* house or 5* lord gets the aspect of Saturn, a slow planet, the native gets very less intelligence. If Jupiter and Mercury are also either afflicted or placed in Papa-kartari yoga or connected to Dush-sthanas, there is likelihood that the native lacks sharp intelligence. If the spouse does not even get average intelligence, there could be cracks in marital life.
3rd lord, if connected to 12* house, one will be having very short memory and problem in hearing or listening. (Chart No. 151)

In the chart illustrated above, the planetary positions are given below:
Sun is in Moala star ruled by Ketu, Moon in Ashwini star ruled by Ketu, Mars in Hasta star ruled by, Mercury is in Jyeshta by himself.
Jupiter is in Pushya ruled by Saturn,
Venus is Purva Ashada ruled by Venus herself, Saturn is in Purva Bhadrapada ruled by Jupiter, Rahu is in Bharani star ruled by Venus,
Ketu is in Visakha star ruled by Jupiter
The lord of the stars in which all the planets posited are indicated in brackets.
3rd house will signify hearing / listening. 3rd house is vacant. Its lord Saturn is in Pisces and gets the aspect of 12* lord Mars. Saturn is posited in Jupiter star who is occupant of 08* house (impediments) while Jupiter himself is aspecting Saturn.
From Moon sign, 03rd lord is Mercury, who signifies hearing and listening, is posited in 08* house in Scorpio, which is a watery (mute) sign. Mercury is aspected by Jupiter who is in Saturn star. Saturn is posited in 12* house. Jupiter himself is lord of 12. Saturn, Mercury and Jupiter are in watery (mute) signs
Hence the native will have problems with reference to hearing
/ listening, which hampers communication skills.
Intelligence
For intelligence, take 05* house along with 03rd house. In the case referred above, 03rd house has been dicussed. 05* lord is Mars, who signifies 05, 12, 10, 08, 05. Mars is aspected by Saturn,
who signifies 03, 02, 04, 08, 01 houses.
Moon and Rahu are occupants of 05* house. Moon signifies 05, 08, 11 while Rahu signifies 05,06,11, and 01 through Venus.
 

 

Rahu is in Aries and will signify Mars. (Signification of Mars is discussed). l-lence it is felt that 05* house has got 06, 08, 12 links along with Saturn, the planet of slow moving. Mercury, the planet of intelligence is posited in 12* house in own star (strong) in a mute sign.
These combinations and significations has resulted in a very average intelligence level for the native.
If the spouse lacks intelligence, communicative skills and memory, it is felt that marital life will have to be compromised by the partner to a larger extent.
Exalted Planet
If Ase. or Ase. lord is found somehow connected to exaltation, the native is found to be very egoistic. Such types of persons do stand unconvinced. This could happen if:
a)	Ase. is posited by an exalted planet.
b)	Ase. lord is exalted.
c)	Ase. is aspected by an exalted planet.
d)	Ase. lord is conjoined with an exalted planet.
e)	Ase. lord is posited in the star of a planet, who is exalted.

In the chart given above (No.152), Sun is posited in lagna and is aspecting 07* house. Sun is treated as cruel planet (not a malefic), who sheds the sunrays relentlessly without any favour. Hence it transfers some sort of non-caring attitude towards 07* house, which deals with spousely matters.
Mars and Venus in Trine
When Mars and Venus are posited in trine (01, 05, 09) houses in a female chart, it is bound to create some sort of marital discord. But for Taurus and Libra, Mars is the lord of 07* house whereas for Scorpio and Aries, Venus is the lord of the 07* house.

In this chart illustrated above (No.153) of a female, Venus and Mars are in trine, which in most of the cases promote quarrels, if the 07* house is afflicted or 07* lord is not properly placed. 07* lord Jupiter is posijed in 12* house along with Mars. 06* lord Saturn is aspecting 07th house from lagna.
Because of these combinations, native found it difficult to adjust with her husband on several occasions. This has happened especially during the saade-saath period (transit Saturn's traverse over natal Moon).
Jupiter in 7th House
Jupiter is treated as pure benefic and said to add crores of guna (good} to the chart. But Jupiter also is treated as a planet who escalates or swells any signification connected with it, besides making the native quite adamant in nature.
In female charts, if Jupiter is placed in 07* house, and in such condition, if the 7* lord is having negative connections, then the native is likely to suffer from difficulties in marital life. She will find an adamant, slightly sadistic husband.

In the chart of female mentioned above (No.154), Jupiter is exalted and is posited in 07* house. The 7* lord Moon is in 06* house, making the marital life difficult and uneasy. Jupiter in 07* house has added fuel to fire, making her spouse as suspicious and sadistic.
 

Laziness
If the lagna lord is posited in a fixed sign, native is found to be lazy. If Saturn & Rahu are conjoined and is connected with Ase, then also the native is found to be lazy.

ln this chart (No. 157), Ketu is an occupant of 5* house in Aquarius. A Node in Aquarius will also signify Saturn. Here Saturn is lord and occupant of 4* house (mind). Hence Ketu becomes a significator of 4th house, making the person moody. Also, from Moon sign, Rahu is posited in Ketu star Makha, further making the person extremely moody some times, especially in Rahu dasha.
