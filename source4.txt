Ch. 1. Birth of Horāśāstra
1. Glory to the Sun-God, whose very breathing causes Creation in this world, with whose rising all the animals (living beings) wake up (from the sleep of their ignorance), whose state at the head (zenith) accentuates all activities (throws the brightest light on one's wisdom) and whose setting (absence, weakness) causes all to sleep. Such Sun-God has his efficacy spread (all over).

2-4. Varaha Mihira in his Horāśāstra, i.e. Bŗhat Jataka, stated briefly the essence of the teachings of the learned sages viz. ten divisions of the Zodiacal Sign, Raja Yogas, longevity, effects of planetary periods etc. This could not be done elaborately by him and hence I am conveying in this work such useful essence, as called out from Yavanas etc., rejecting other unuseful portions, which may be appended to the said Brihat Jataka.

5. I, Kalyana Varma, whose fame on account of patronizing Gods and administering villages and cities is brilliant, like that of a female swan in the cage of the universe, who is the king of Vyagrapada region, present this Saravali, an astrological treatise, with a chaste heart.

6. Saravali is a river with chilly water, which has taken its birth in the mountain called Kalyana Varma, to ward off the thirst for astrology of those interested.

Thus ends the 1st Ch. Birth of Horāśāstra in Kalyana Varma's Sāravalī

Ch. 2. Meaning of Horā
1-5. The Creator Brahma has written on the foreheads of all living beings their fates, which are deciphered by the astrologers through their pure insight. The first and last letters in the word Ahorātra are removed and the word Horā is thus born and has come to exist. The Zodiac and the planets are therein, as discussed. Some scholars say Horāśāstra is indicative of effects of one's Karma, i.e. fate. Some call Lagna, or half of a Rāśi, as Horā. In practice the science relating to horoscope is called Horāśāstra. Horā is capable of analyzing the destiny. Barring this Horāśāstra there is no device to help one earn money, to help, as a boat, to cross the ocean of unexpected situations and to serve, as an advisor in journey.

Thus ends the 2nd Ch. Meaning of Horā in Kalyana Varma's Sāravalī

Ch. 3. Rāśi Description
1-2. At the time of Pralaya (Destruction) the Universe plunged into darkness and was flooded with water, when all of a sudden the Sun-God with his brilliant rays appeared in the Universe. He created all the planets and the 12 months.

3-4. Description of the 12 Rāśis. The names of the 12 Rāśis are Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces. The Sign Aquarius resembles a man holding a pot, while Gemini is compared to a couple holding Veena and mace. A pair of fish is the imagination about Pisces. Sagittarius is compared to a man having a hip, like that of a horse and holding an arch in his hands. Deer-faced Sign is Capricorn. Virgo resembles a virgin sitting in a boat with a lamp in her hands. A male holding Scales in his hand represents Libra. The other Signs are identical with their names.

5-6. The Limbs of KalaPurusha and their Use. The Signs Aries etc. represent the limbs of Kalapurusha, as under: Aries head, Taurus face, Gemini arms, Cancer heart, Leo stomach, Virgo hip, Libra space below navel and private parts, Scorpio private parts, Sagittarius thighs, Capricorn knees, Aquarius ankles, Pisces feet. If at birth one has benefic planet in a particular Sign, the particular limb will be strong. A malefic makes such a limb weak.

7. Synonyms of Rāśis. Kriya, Tavuru, Jutuma, Kulira, Leya, Pathona, Jook, Kaurpika, Tauksha, Akokera, Hridaya Roga and Anthya are the other names given, respectively, to Rāśis from Aries onwards.

8. Synonyms for Houses. Riksha, Rāśi, Kshetra, Bha and Bhavana are identical names given to a House by the sages.

9-10. Zodiacal Halves, their Lords and Effects. The Rāśi Chakra with 12 Rāśis is called Bhagana. Six Signs counted from Leo to Capricorn consist of Solar Half and the Sun rules this Half-Zodiac. Six Signs in the reverse order from Cancer to Aquarius are Lunar Half and ruled by the Moon. Barring Cancer and Leo, planets from Mars to Saturn get one Rāśi each in each Half. If at birth more planets occupy the Solar Half, the native is brilliant and, if more planets are in Lunar Half, he is soft, good and lucky.

11. The Rulers of Rāśis and Navāńśas. Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Saturn and Jupiter are the Lords, respectively, of Aries to Pisces. The Navāńśas for these Rāśis are calculated from Aries, Capricorn, Libra and Cancer in their order.

12. Sub-Divisions Essential. The effects of a horoscope should be predicted according to the divisions of Houses. Without knowing the strength of such Lords, one cannot lay even a step forward in the direction of astrology.

13. Vargothamamsa. The first Navāńśa of a Movable Rāśi, the 5th one in a Fixed Rāśi and the 9th one in a Common (Dual) Rāśi are called Vargothamamsa. Should the natal Lagna be in such Vargothama Navāńśa, the native becomes an important person in his circle. The rulers of Dwadasamasas start from that Rāśi itself.

14. Lords of Decanates and Horas. The Lords of decanates are first Lord of the same Rāśi, second Lord of the 5th Rāśi therefrom and third Lord of the 9th from the Rāśi in question. The first Hora of an odd Rāśi belongs to the Sun, while the second one is ruled by the Moon. In the case of an even Rāśi the first Hora is ruled by the Moon and the second by the Sun.

15. Lords of Trimsamsas. In odd Signs 5, 5, 8, 7 and 5 degrees are Trimsamsas of Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury and Venus, respectively, while the arrangement is reverse in even Signs.

16. Lords of Sapthamsas. The Sapthamsas for the 12 Rāśis from Aries onwards are, respectively, counted from Aries, Scorpio, Gemini, Capricorn, Leo, Pisces, Libra, Taurus, Sagittarius, Cancer, Aquarius and Virgo. The Lords thereof are those, in whose Rāśis they fall.

l7. The total of the number of Horas and that of decanates is sixty (24+36) in the entire Zodiac. The figure is increased by 72, if the total of Horas + Navāńśas is required, i.e. 60+72=24+108=132. Each Rāśi has 1800 Kalas (30°, each of 60').

18. Different Vargas. To know any kind of Varga (Hora, Navāńśa, Drekkana etc.) adopt the following method. Convert the longitude into minutes of arc and multiply by the Varga figure concerned. Divide the product by 1800. The resultant figure will reveal the required Varga.

19. The malefic and benefic effects of such Vargas are explained in detail in the Nashta Jataka chapters (at the end).

20-21. Rāśis Benefic and Malefic, Gandanta and its Effects. From Aries onwards alternatively the Rāśis are known, as malefic and benefic on the one hand and male and female on the other hand. These are also classified, as Chara (Movable), Sthira (Fixed, Immovable) and DvisvaBhava (Ubhaya, Dual, Common) Rāśis. The ending portions of Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces are called Gandanta. It is said, that one born in Gandanta will not survive. He will either lose his mother, or he will end the dynasty, i.e. he is the last of his descent and will not have any children. If, however, he survives, he becomes a king with many elephants and horses.

22. Directions of Rāśis. The four Rāśis from Aries onwards indicate East, South, West and North, while the remaining Rāśis repeat in the same way. A journey undertaken by a person towards the direction indicated by the Lagna, or the Moon (at the commencement of journey) yields fruitful results.

23. DigBala and KalaBala. Human Signs, quadruped Signs, Scorpio and watery Signs are, respectively, strong in the directions commencing from the East. Further during night-time quadruped Signs, day-time human, or biped Signs and the second half of Capricorn, Scorpio, Cancer and Pisces are strong at the time of daybreak and of nightfall.

24. Gemini, Cancer, Capricorn Aries, Taurus and Sagittarius are night Signs. Leo, Libra, Scorpio, Aquarius, Pisces and Virgo are day Signs. The Signs Cancer, Capricorn, Aries, Sagittarius and Taurus are called Prishtodaya, which rise with hind part. Sīrshodaya Signs (rising with head) are Leo, Libra, Scorpio, Virgo, Aquarius and Gemini. The Sign Pisces is Ubhayodaya (rises with both head and hind part).

25. Strength of Rāśi. If a Rāśi is aspected by its Lord, or by a planet, that is friendly to its Lord, or by Mercury, or by Jupiter, it is said to be strong. Planets other than the above do not lend strength by aspect.

26-27. Synonyms of 12 Bhavas. Lagna Thanu and Sakthi, Second Artha and Dhana, Third Sahaja and Parakrama, Fourth Bandhava and Griha, Fifth Putra and Pratibha, Sixth Ari and Vrana, Seventh Stri and Kama, Eighth Vinasa and Dehavivara, Ninth Punya and Guru, Tenth Karma and Mana, Eleventh Aya and Bhava, Twelfth Vyaya.

28-31. Additional Synonyms. The 4th (Veśma) and the 8th are called, as Caturaśra Houses. The 9th is known, as Tapa, i.e. penance. The 4th has names, like耠Sukha (happiness), Jala (water), Patala (nether-world), Bandhu (relatives) and Hibuka. The other names given to the 10th House are Karma (deed), Agna (command), Gagana (sky, zenith) and Meshurana. The 5th and 9th are Trines. The 5th is the only House connected with Dhī, while the 9th is Tritrikona, the Trine of Trine. The 7th House is called Dyuna, Astha (setting), Jāya and Jamitra. The 6th is Shatkona, 3rd is Duschikya and 12th Rippha. Kutumba is the 2nd.

32. Kendra, Apoklima and Panaphara, Effects thereof. The adjoining Houses with reference to Angles (Kendras) are Panaphara. The Houses next to Panapharas are Apoklimas. The planets in Angles give effects in one's boyhood. The effects of planets in Panapharas are felt in the middle age, while the planets in Apoklima give result at the conclusion of the native's life.

33. Upachaya and Anupachaya. The 6th, 10th 11th and 3rd are called Upachaya Houses, while the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 12th are Anupachayas.

34. Moolatrikonas of Planets. Leo, Taurus, Aries, Virgo, Sagittarius, Libra and Aquarius are the respective Moolatrikonas for the planets from the Sun onwards.

35-36. Exaltation and Fall. Aries, Taurus, Capricorn, Virgo, Cancer, Pisces and Libra, respectively, are the Signs of exaltation for the Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn. These are deeply exalted at 10, 3, 28, 15, 5, 27 and 20 Degrees in the respective Rāśis. The Rāśis opposite exaltation are the places of debilitation for the planets concerned. And the respective degrees are of deep fall.

37-38. Long, Medium and Short Ascensions of Signs. Pisces, Taurus, Aries and Aquarius are Signs Of short ascension. Gemini, Sagittarius, Cancer and Capricorn are of medium ascension. The long ascension Signs are Scorpio, Virgo, Leo and Libra. The head and other organs of the native will be similar to the Sign ascending at birth and other relative Signs. The planets occupying such Houses will also influence the form and shape of the various organs.

39. Favourable Directions for Journeys. The direction ruled by the Lord of a Rāśi becomes Plava direction for that Rāśi. This is Yavana's school of thought. If the king undertakes his journey towards such direction, indicated by the Rāśi concerned, he attains quick success.

40-4l. Colours of Rāśis. From Aries onwards the following 12 colours are allotted to the various Rāśis, respectively, red, white, green, pink, brown, gray, variegated, black, golden, yellow, deep-brown and white. If an idol of the Lord of the Ascendant is made in the colour allotted and is worshipped, the native will destroy his enemies, just as Lord Indra destroyed the demons.

Thus ends the 3rd Ch. Rāśi Description of Kalyana Varma's Saravali

Ch. 4. Planetary Characters
1-2. Kalapurusha's Soul etc. and their Use. The Sun is the soul of the Zodiac personified, the Moon mind, Mars strength, Mercury speech (voice), Jupiter intelligence, Venus comforts, Rahu ego and Saturn grief. If at birth planets indicative of soul etc. are strong, these significations will equally be strong. If these planets are weak, the effects are only meager. But in the case of Saturn it is different.

3-6. The counting of limbs according to the decanate rising at birth should be identified, as under. If the first decanate rises, count from head. If second, from neck and, if 3rd, from pelvis. The 6 Rāśis backwards from the Ascendant denote the left side of the body, while the 6 forward Rāśis from Lagna indicate the right side of the body. Should the first decanate of a Sign ascend, the lapsed part of the Ascendant denotes left side of the head and the part to rise yet indicates the right side of the head, the 2nd and 12th denote right and left eyes, respectively, 3rd and 11th right and left ears, 4th and 10th right and left nose, 5th and 9th right and left cheeks, 6th and 8th right and left chins and the 7th left side of the face (area yet to rise) and the 7th right side of the face (portion already descended). If the 2nd decanate rises, neck, shoulder, arms, side, heart, stomach and navel are to be understood in the same order. Should the third decanate rise, pelvis, anus, penis, testicle, thigh, knee, calf and feet will be counted in the same order. The decanates occupied by malefics denote wounds etc., while the ones by benefics indicate marks (moles) on the limbs concerned. Should these planets be in their own Rāśi, or Amsa at birth, then the wound, or mole are right from birth. Otherwise these will be caused later on (in appropriate periods).

7. Planetary Portfolios and their Use. The Sun and the Moon are said to be the kings. Mercury is the prince, Mars Army chief, Jupiter and Venus ministers, while Saturn is servant. The native acquires such qualities, as of the strongest planet.

30. Temporary Friendship and Enmity between Planets. If a planet is in the 12th, 4th, 2nd, 10th, 11th and 3rd from another planet, then there is temporary friendship between the two. If the position is in the 6th, 7th, 8th, 1st, 5th, or the 9th, then there is temporary enmity among them. (This may be applied to a birth horoscope, horary horoscope, or any such other context)

31. Five Kinds of Considerations of Relationship. Should there be temporary friendship and natural friendship between two planets, then they become extremely friendly. If there is natural neutrality and temporary friendship, there exists only friendship between two planets. If there is natural enmity and temporary friendship, they are neutral in relationship. Should they be naturally neutral and temporarily inimical, they are only inimical. If there is enmity both naturally and temporarily, then they are greatly inimical to each other.

32-33. Planetary Aspects. Planets lend ¼ aspect on the 3rd and 10th, half aspect on the 4th and 8th, ¾ aspect on 5th and 9th and full aspect on the 7th from their positions. Saturn has special full aspect on the 3rd and 10th, Jupiter on the 5th and the 9th and Mars on the 4th and 8th. All planets aspect the 7th fully.

34. Planetary Strengths. To assess the auspicious and inauspicious effects of a planet, its directional, positional, temporal and motional strengths are important, for without these it is considered to be weak.

35. Directional and Positional Strengths. Jupiter and Mercury have directional strength, while in the Ascendant (East), the Sun and Mars in the 10th (South), Saturn in the 7th (West) and the Moon and Venus in the 4th (North). If a planet is in exaltation, Mulatrikona, own House, friendly House, or own Navāńśa and aspected by a benefic, it assumes strength. The Moon and Venus are strong in even Rāśis, while the rest are so in odd Rāśis. This is called positional strength.

36. Temporal and Motional Strengths. The Sun, Jupiter and Venus acquire strength during day-time, while Saturn, the Moon and Mars become strong during night-time. Mercury acquires vigour at all times. The Hora Bala goes to Hora Lord, Masa Bala (Masa - month) to the Lord of the month, Dina Bala to the Lord of the week-day of birth and Abda (year) Bala is credited to the Lord of the year of birth. Malefics get strength in Dark Half, while benefics become strong in Bright Half. The planet, that is victorious in war, that is in its retrograde motion, or, that is not combust become strong. The Luminaries get strength in northern course. This is how Satyacharya detailed motional strength.

37. Ayana Bala. Venus, Mars, the Sun and Jupiter are strong in Uttarayana, while the Moon and Saturn are strong in Dakshinayana. Mercury is strong in both the cases. This is called Ayana Bala.

38. Drekkana Bala. Male planets are strong in the first decanate, female planets in the third decanate and neutral planets in the second decanate of a Rāśi. Planets are strong, only when they are away from the Sun, as per Yavanas.

39. Tribhaga Bala, or Triamsa Bala. The Moon, Venus and Mars get this strength in the first, second and third parts of the night, respectively. This is similarly enjoyed by Mercury, the Sun and Saturn in day-time, while Jupiter has it always, irrespective of day, or night.

40. Naisargika Bala (Natural Strength). Saturn, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Moon and Sun are stronger than the other in the ascending order. Should there be similarity in other strengths, then the one with greater natural strength prevails.

Thus ends the 4th Ch. Planetary Characters of Kalyana Varma's Saravali

Ch. 5. Miscellaneous Matters
1. After discussing the Ch. Rāśi Prabheda (Ch. 3) and Graha Yoni Bheda, or Graha Gunadhyaya (Ch. 4) I now explain Misrakadhyaya (Miscellaneous Ch.), which is the most supreme of all.

2-4. Avasthas, or States of Planets. Planets have nine states of being, viz. Dīpta (radiant), Svastha (confident), Mudita (rejoiced), Santa (peaceful), Sakta (strong), Nipīdita (oppressed), Bhita (alarmed), Vikala (mutilated) and Khala. A planet in its exaltation is said to be in Dīptavastha. In its own House, it is in Svasthavastha, friendly House Muditavastha, in beneficial Vargas Santavastha, with bright rays Saktavastha, in combustion Vikalavastha, if defeated in planetary war, Nipīdita, in malefic Vargas Khalavastha and, if in fall, in Bhitavastha.

Notes. There are 27 Graha Samayas, i.e. planetary conditions. These will help us know, as to what a planet is doing at a particular moment with reference to either birth, or query. Such positions reveal specific results. How to calculate these positions and the effects thereof are noted below. Find out the number of Signs from Aries to Ascendant. Again find out in what number of Sign is the planet, for which (Samaya) is required, counted from Aries. Multiply these figures mutually and again the latest product be multiplied by the total number of Dasa period years of the planet, as per Vimsottari Dasha scheme. Divide this by 27 and the remainder indicates Graha Samaya (some scholars, however, advise, that the planet's position is to be counted from Lagna instead of Aries. It is wrong counting the planet's position from Lagna, as the Sloka clearly says, vide Jyotisharnava Navanītam). Let us assume, that in Virgo Lagna chart the Moon is in Sagittarius. Hence we count six Signs from Aries through Virgo Ascendant and get 6. Again from Aries to Sagittarius we get 9. Multiply 9 by 6 to get 54. The Dasha period of the Moon is 10. When we multiply 54 by 10, we get 540. This, when divided by 27, yields no balance and hence the 27th Samaya is denoted.

Now the scheme of Samayas and their effects (1-27). Snana: good family, children, respect, success and position. Vastradharana: precious stones, money, position and clothes. Pundradharana: dear to people, gains in foreign countries, hard work and honour. Upadesa: lands, conveyances and happiness. Siva Pūja: fond of lands, royal wrath, expenses and litigations. Āposana: wealth, fond of wicked people. Vishnvarchana: bile, grief, highly learned. Vipraradhana: fortune, gains from lands, success over enemies, rich relatives. Namaskara: soft-spoken, conveyances and capability to speak on either side in arguments. Adri Pradakshina: bilious diseases, dysentery, litigations and penalties. Vaisyadeva: position with king, good family, perennial progress. Athithi Satkara: cheat, jimminks and monetary gains. Bhojana: sick, dismissed from the circle, cheating. Ambhapana: bad meal, bad acts. Ahamkara: egoism and enmity with people. Tambūla: good position, high learning, money and fame of high order. Nripalapa: respect, pious disposition, diviee cows. Kirītadharana: big position in Army, learned, wealthy. Ekanta Sambhashana: lazy, soft-spoken. Ālasya: abundant education, lazy, careless. Sayana: very short-tempered, sick, disputes in family. Amritapana: foolish, harmful, blaming elders, destruction (some texts prescribe good results, which only seem to be sensible). Madhupana: health, good children, beautiful wife, rich food. Dhanarjana: respect, much wealth, skilful. Bhikshatana: loss, bad teaching. Nidra: long-lasting diseases, drunkard. Sambhoga: attached to base women, cunning and revengeful.

5. Effects of a Radiant Planet. Should a planet be in Dīpta state at birth, the native burns his enemies with the fire of his valour. He gathers all kinds of wealth. His (band of) elephants soak the surface of the earth with the juice, or ichor exuding from their temples. (That is the native will own a large number of elephants. See the simultaneous literary ability of Kalyana Varma. A number of such comparisons can be found in this work)

6. Effects of a Confident Planet. Should a planet be in Svastha state at birth, the native acquires gold, family etc. He will be a justice in a king's employ. He will own houses and will amass grains. His family will prosper.

7. Effects of a Rejoicing Planet. If a planet is in Mudita state at birth, the native will be pleasingly disposed, will have wife, gold, diamonds etc., will win the entire band of his foes and will enjoy all kinds of comforts in life.

8. Effects of a Peaceful Planet. If a planet is in Santa, or peaceful state at birth, the native will have peaceful mind, comfort and wealth. He will be a king's minister, will be learned, helpful to others, religious and fortunate.

9. Effects of a Śakta Planet. If a planet is in Śakta state at birth, the native will have wife, clothes, scents, garlands etc. He will be famous, liked by all and have his name spread all-over.

10. Effects of a Hurt Planet. If a planet is in Pīdita (hurt, oppressed) state at birth, the native will be subjected to grief and sickness and will have enemies. He will be deprived of his own people and wander from one country to the other.

11. Effects of an Alarmed Planet. Should a planet be in Bhita state at birth, the native, even, if he were a king with varied paraphernalia, will be troubled by enemies. He will lose his men. He will be defeated and will become poor.

12. Effects of a Mutilated Planet. If a planet is in Vikala state at birth, the native will be deprived of his place, or position, dirty-hearted, poor and will wander here and there. He will be frightened by his enemies.

13. Effects of a Planet in Khalavastha. Should a planet be in Khalavastha, the native will grieve in sorrow, due to maintaining his wife (the native cannot maintain even his wife), will lose all his wealth, will have an impure mind and be never free from miseries.

14. Retrogression in Exaltation. If a planet is retrograde, while in exaltation, it produces no effect (nothing good will happen). This is the view held by some. Even, if it is in exaltation by its entry in retrograde motion from the next Sign (for example Jupiter entering Cancer from Leo), the effect is same, for it takes unduly long time in such traversion.

15. Different Effects. A planet in exaltation is considered highly strong. It is medium in strength in its Mulatrikona Rāśi, or own House. Its strength is only nominal, if it be aspected by a friendly planet, or be in a friendly Rāśi.

16-17. The elders among Yavanas say, that the Moon is of medium strength for ten days commencing from Sukla Padyami, i.e. first of Bright Lunar Half. During the following ten days (from the 11th day, or Ekadasi of Bright Lunar Half through the 5th day, or Panchami of Dark Lunar Half, or Krishna Paksha) she is exceedingly strong. And during the third ten-day period (from the 6th day, or Shashti of Dark Lunar Half through the New Moon day, or Amavasya) she has very little strength. If at birth the Moon has brilliant rays, is bright circled and full, it makes the native an unencounterable king.

18. Good Results in Mid-Life. If at birth the Lord of Moon Sign, or the Lord of the Ascendant, or Jupiter be in Kendra, the native is happy in the middle of his life.

19-20. The effects revealed by various Rāśis will correspond to the strengths of their Lords. Should two planets have identical strength, the one with higher Naisarga Bala will prevail. According to Chudamani Acharya the Ascendant's strength equals that of its Lord.

21-24. Swakshetra, Mulatrikona etc. In Leo up to 20°, it is the Sun's and the rest is his own House. The Moon's exaltation zone is the first 3° of Taurus, with the remaining portion being her Mulatrikona. Up to 12° in Aries Mars is in Mulatrikona, the rest is his own House. Mercury in Virgo has the first 15°, as exaltation, the next 5 (15°1'-20°), as Mulatrikona and the remaining portion is termed, as own House. In Sagittarius first 10° is Jupiter's Mulatrikona, with the rest being own House. The first 5° in Libra is Mulatrikona of Venus and the balance his own House. Aquarius is Mulatrikona for Saturn in the initial 20° portion and the last 10° in Aquarius is his own House.

25. Effects of Exalted Planets etc. If a planet is exalted, it gives auspicious results to full extent. It is futile, if in debilitation. The results are limited in an enemy's camp. The auspicious effects given by a planet are ¼ in a friendly House, ½ in own House and ¾ in Mulatrikona Rāśi.

26. Inauspiciousness of Planets. A planet is fully inauspicious, if it is in its debilitation; it is somewhat better in inimical House. Its inauspicious effects are nil, if it is exalted, ¾ in friendly House, ½ in own House and ¼ in Mulatrikona Rāśi.

27. The planetary combination, that produces Utpata, the planet, that is combust by the Sun, with less brilliance, which is in debilitation, in enemy's camp, or, that is defeated in planetary war: such a planet not only loses its potence to be auspicious, but also becomes capable of bestowing malefic effects in full.

28-30. Effects According to Exaltation etc. A planet in exaltation gives all kinds of wealth. It confers ministership, or leadership over Army, if in Mulatrikona Rāśi. If it is in own House, it gives happiness, money, grains, wealth etc. In a friendly House, it gives fame, splendour, abundant good fortune, long-lasting wealth and also wealth through king. A planet, that is in its own Hora, makes one courageous.

31-33. A planet in its own decanate confers virtues, while the one in own Navāńśa makes one famous. Courage, wealth and fame are bestowed by a planet occupying its own Sapthamsa. One becomes devout and helpful, if a planet is in its own Dvadasamsa. A planet in own Trimsamsa gives happiness and good qualities. When a planet is aspected by a benefic planet, the native becomes wealthy, famous, fortunate, chief of all, beautiful and happy.

34-35. If a planet is with Ojha, or Yugma Bala (strength by being in male, or female Rāśis), the native is worshipped by the public, expert in arts, pleased, immune to sickness and prone to fear of other Worlds. A planet with positional strength gives perennial happiness, friendship, courage, fixity of mind and independent profession, or work.

36-38. A planet with directional strength takes the native to the direction ruled by it and gives clothes, jewels, conveyances etc. And the native is happy in such a direction. A planet with Ayana Bala similarly takes the native to its direction and confers various kinds of wealth apart from fame. In both the cases, the planets should not be combust, or debilitated. If a planet has Cheshta Bala, it sometimes gives kingdom, sometimes respect, sometimes money and yet sometimes increases the fame of the native.

39. Effects of Retrograde Planets. A benefic, if retrograde, is strong and is capable of conferring kingdom. If a malefic is retrograde, it causes grief and purposeless wandering.

40. Auspicious Planets. A planet with clear rays, or, that is conjunct with the Moon, or, that has won in a planetary war, is capable of bestowing complete happiness and kingdom, that cannot be seized.

41. Diva Bala and Ratri Bala. A planet, that has Diva Bala, or Ratri Bala, is capable of conferring lands, elephants etc. Such a native defeats his enemies with courage and achieves kingdom and wealth.

42. Effects of Lord of Year etc. The Lords of the year, month, week and Hora improve two-fold in their Dasas happiness, wealth and fame. That is the Lord of the month gives two-fold results, as against year Lord, the week Lord two-fold of month Lord and the Hora Lord two-fold of week Lord.

43. Effects of Paksha Bala. A planet with Paksha Bala destroys enemies and confers diamonds, robes, conveyances, wife, gold, land and fame.

44. Effects of a Planet with all Sources of Strengths. Should a planet have all kinds of strengths stated so far and be bright with unobscured rays, it confers kingdom exceeding the desires of the native.

45. Benefic Planets with all-round Strength. If at birth benefic planets possess all-round strength, the native will have good habits, be truthful, upright, beautiful, splendourous and be an expert in all deeds, respectful towards the wise and Gods and will be blessed with scents, garlands, robes, ornaments etc.

46. Malefics with all-round Strength. Should malefics be with such all-round strength at birth, the native will be a miser, will do bad acts, be selfish, jealous of virtuous people, intent on promoting quarrels, wicked, torturous, dirty, ungrateful, slanderous and ugly.

47-50. Planetary Stages and Effects thereof. It is boyhood, if a planet is in its own House, or friendly House. In Mulatrikona Rāśi, it is in youth and in adolescence in exaltation. It is said to be in old stage, if it occupies an inimical House. A planet in debilitation is in extrimis. The corresponding effects are felt in the respective planetary Dashas, i.e. periods. The results for such stages are, respectively, happiness, virtue, kingdom, sickness with debts and death, or expenses.

51-52. Effects of Planets in Odd and Even Rāśis. A planet in odd Rāśi with strength makes the native courageous and a warrior. If it is weak in odd Rāśi, the native is cruel and dull-witted. A planet in even Rāśi gives soft nature, fear for quarrels, love for water, flowers and clothes, good fortune, health and protection of own men.

Thus ends the 5th Ch. Miscellaneous Matters in Kalyana Varma's Saravali

Ch. 6. (Yoga) Karakas
1. Karaka Planets. Planets posited in own House, Mulatrikona, or exaltation and simultaneously in Angles become mutual Karakas, or significators. Such kind of Yoga Karakas (co-workers) are counted only in regard to Lagna's Angles. This view is held by Acharya Hari.

2. For example Saturn in Libra, while Cancer Ascendant containing Jupiter and the Moon and Mars with the Sun in Aries become mutual Karakas.

3. Planets posited in exaltation, friendly Rāśi, own Rāśi, or Amsa also become Karakas. The Sun in the 10th, as above, becomes greatly significant. This is Chanakya's opinion.

4. Planets though not in Vargas, like own House, become Karakas, if they are in Lagna, 4th, 10th, or even the 11th. But this view is not acceptable to great sages.

5-6. Effects of Karakas. Even though a person may be born in base strata, he will become chief, if he has Karaka Grahas. One born in royal family without doubt becomes a king in such a case. While analyzing the Yogas, such Karakatwas are along important and effects should be declared only on that basis.

Thus ends the 6th Ch. entitled Karakadhyaya in Kalyana Varma's Saravali

Ch. 7. Planetary Indications
1. Lord of Week-Day etc. The Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn rule the week-days etc. Whichever planet becomes the Lord of the first week-day in the month of Aswina in the year of Aswina, will become the Lord of month and year.

2-3. The fourth planet counted from the Lord of the first year rules the second year. Similar counting of fourth Lords for the subsequent years should be made to know the Lords thereof. There are 24 Horas (planetary hours) in each day (from one Sun-rise to the next). The first Hora is ruled by the Lord of the week day, while the subsequent ones are ruled by the Lords of the sixth week-days thereof. Thirty (Savana) days make one (Savana) month. To know the Lord of the week-day in particular month, the months past should be multiplied by 30, increased by one and divided by 7. The remainder represents the Lord of the week-day counted from the earlier week-day Lord.

4. A Savana month has 30 days and each month, viz. Chaitra, Vaisakha etc., commences with the first day of Bright half and ends with the 30th Thiti (Amavasya).

5-6. Bhava Effects. The good effects relating to a Bhava can be better reaped, if an enterprise relating to that Bhava is started in an Ascendant ruled by the Lord of that Bhava, or, when the Lord thereof is in an Upachaya House, or on the week-day, Hora, year, or month ruled by that Bhava Lord. The good effects will be 25% by year Lord, 50% by month Lord, 75% by Lord of week and 100% by Hora Lord.

7-13. Planet's Rulerships. The Sun rules snakes, wool, hills, gold, weapons, poison, fire, medicines, kings, Aryas (foreigners in general), river banks, forest, wood and Mantras. The Moon indicates poets, flowers, eatables, beads, silver, conch, salt, water, arrow, robes, ornaments, females, Ghī, sesamum, oil and sleep. Mars rules blood, copper, Army, red cloth. Mercury minerals, earth, king, destruction, swooning, bile and thieves. Mercury rules Veda, writing, sculpture, medicines, expertise, ministership, speech, jokes, birds, couples, fame, Vanaspathi (a large forest tree, which bears fruit apparently without any blossoms) and gold. Jupiter rules auspiciousness, virtue, physical stoutness, prowess, preceptorship, deputation, city, state (province), gold, bed, conveyance, position, grains, residence and sons. Venus rules diamonds, ornaments, marriage, scents, friends, wreaths, females, cow dung, diagnosis (apart from meaning diagnosis also indicates end, purity, rope to tying up a calf etc.), education, sexual enjoyment and gold. Saturn is Karaka for lead, zinc, black metals, inferior grains, dead relatives, fools, servants, mean women, salable goods, poor people and self-restraint (apart from meaning self-restraint also means investing with sacred thread, which is in vogue to give “second birth” to Brahmins).

14-15. Planetary Places. The Sun rules Kalinga (a Coromandel district), the Moon Yavana (Greek, Mohamedan, or European countries), Venus plain river banks, Jupiter Sindhu (Indus), Mercury Magadha (southern part of Bihar), Saturn Saurashtra (Gujarat), Mars Ujjain and the nodes Dravida country (five tribes: Dravida, Karnataka, Gūrjara, Maharashtra and Tailanga).

Thus ends the 7th Ch. entitled Karakadhyaya in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Ch. 8. Conception
1-3. A Female Menstruation. Without the knowledge of conception time one cannot understand the effects of the various divisions, like Rāśi. That is why I explain below about conception, which is the cause of births of all animals. As a result of Moon's transit in Anupachaya Rāśis and in aspect of Mars, a female obtains her menses. The Moon is water and Mars is fire. Water produces blood and fire produces bile. When blood is enraged by bile, the women gets her menstruation.

4-7. The menstruation so caused makes the female capable of conception. If the Moon is in Upachaya, it makes the menses defunct for conception. However, if the Moon in Upachaya is aspected by Jupiter, or her friends, or especially Venus, the woman affectionately cohabits with the male. If the Moon is aspected by Mars, the female unites with a person other than husband. The Sun, if aspecting the Moon, indicates a king, while Saturn aspecting denotes a servant. Similar inferences should be made, if the Moon is aspected by malefics only, without aspect of benefics. If the Moon is aspected by malefics, like Mars, then the female gives up her home and becomes a prostitute.

8-10. The 7th House from Lagna at the time of copulation indicates the disposition of the couple. If there is a malefic's aspect to the Lagna at the time of copulation, the couple unites angrily and with quarrel. Should it be benefic's aspect, then the sexual enjoyment will be (pleasing), as enumerated by Vatasyayana Mahāŗşi. If there be both malefic and benefic aspects on the 7th, the sexual act is mixed in nature. According to one's past deeds, to ripe its fruits the semen enters the womb and conception ensues.

11-12. Occurrence of Pregnancy. If the transit Sun and Venus be in Upachaya Rāśis with strength with reference to the male partner's nativity and occupy even Navamsas, there is scope of pregnancy to be caused by the particular intercourse. Similar effects follow, if strong Moon and strong Mars be in Upachaya Rāśis in transit with reference to the female's horoscope and be in even Navamsas. Alternatively Venus, Sun, Mars and Moon should be in Upachaya Houses in own Amsas, or Jupiter be in Lagna, 5th, or 9th with strength to cause pregnancy.

13. Disposition of Fetus. The child in the womb will be according to the mental disposition of the couple and their desires and according to Tridoshas (bile, phlegm and wind) prevailing.

14-15. Sex of the Child. Should Lagna, Moon, Jupiter and the Sun be strong and be in male Rāśis and male Navamsas, birth of a male child be predicted. If they are in even Rāśis and even Amsas, predict female child. If strong Jupiter and Sun be in male Rāśis, male child will be born. Female child should be expected, if Venus, Moon and Mars are in even Rāśis.

16. Twin Birth. If the Sun and Jupiter be in Gemini, or Sagittarius in aspect to Mercury, birth of two male children be predicted. Two female children will be born, if Venus, Mars and the Moon be in Pisces, or Virgo in aspect (of) Mercury.

17. Male Birth. If Saturn is in odd House other than Lagna, a male child will be born. Such Yogas and strengths at the time of Adhana should be properly assessed to predict birth of male, or female child.

18-20. Birth of Hermaphrodite. Birth of a hermaphrodite should be declared, if the Sun and the Moon be in odd Rāśis and be in mutual aspect, or, if Mercury and Saturn be in mutual aspect from odd Rāśis, or, if Mars aspects the Sun, who is in an even Rāśi, or, if the Moon is in Lagna in odd Rāśi. These are the views of sages. If Mars aspects Mercury in odd Rāśi and simultaneously the Moon in even Rāśi, same effect follows. Alternatively if Lagna, Moon and Mercury be in odd Rāśi and odd Navāńśa and aspected by Venus and Saturn, eunuch birth is indicated.

21-22. One Male Child and One Female Child to be Born. Should Lagna and Moon be in even Rāśis and be aspected by a strong planet, then there are twins in the womb (one male child and one female child). Similar results follow, if the Moon and Venus are in even Rāśis, or Common Signs and be strong.

23-26. Birth of Triplets. The following Yogas prevailing at the time of Adhana lead to births of triplets. Mercury remaining in Gemini Navāńśa aspecting a planet, who also falls in Common Navāńśa (a), Mercury remaining in Gemini Navāńśa aspecting a Sign, which ascends (b), Mercury in Virgo Navāńśa aspecting a planet falling in Common Navāńśa (c), Mercury in Virgo Navāńśa aspecting a Common Sign, which ascends (d), Mercury in Gemini Amsa aspecting a planet in Gemini Amsa, or Sagittarius Amsa (e), Mercury in Gemini Navāńśa aspecting the Lagna, which falls in Gemini Navāńśa, or Sagittarius Navāńśa (f), Mercury in 7th aspecting a planet in Kanya, or Meena Navāńśa, or aspecting such Lagna Navāńśa (g). Combinations (a) and (b) lead to birth of triplets - one female and two males. Combinations (c) and (d) cause birth of triplets consisting of two females and one male. Combinations at (e) and (f) cause three male children, while the ones at (g) indicate three female children.

27. Mother, Father, etc. If births take place in day-time, Venus indicates mother, while the Sun indicates father. In the case of nights the Moon and Saturn, respectively, play these roles. Similarly the Moon denotes mother's sister and Saturn paternal uncle for day-time births, while Venus and the Sun take over these portfolios, respectively, in the case of night births.

28. Effects of such Planets. If the planets denoting father and paternal uncle are in odd Bhavas, their well-being is assured. If the planets denoting mother and maternal aunt are in even Bhavas, their well-being is to be predicted.

29-31. Process of Growth of Embryo and Lords thereof. The embryo in the womb improves, as under. First month coagulated blood, second mass of flesh, third limbs, fourth bones, fifth skin, sixth hair, seventh movement, eighth feeling of hunger and thirst, ninth excitement and tenth riped, like a fruit and ready for coming out of the womb. These ten months are ruled, respectively, by Venus, Mars, Jupiter, the Sun, the Moon, Saturn, Mercury, Lord of Nisheka Lagna, the Moon and the Sun. The dispositions of these Lords indicate good, or bad of the respective processes.

32-33. Miscarriage. Should a planet be affected by celestial portents, or defeat by malefic at the time of intercourse, miscarriage may take place in the month ruled by the planet concerned. The Ascendant ruling at the time of intercourse can also become cause of miscarriage. If   Saturn and Mars be in the said Ascendant, or the Moon be in a House of Mars, or Saturn, the results mentioned will come to pass.

34. Comfortable Carrying. Should the Adhana Ascendant be occupied by Moon, or should there be benefics in the 5th, 9th, 7th, 2nd, 10th, 4th and malefics relegated to 3rd and 11th aspected by the Sun, the carrying female is safe.

35-41. Adversities to the Pregnant Woman. If at the time of Adhana the Sun and the Moon are hemmed between two malefics, while the Ascendant has no benefic aspect, the female concerned dies. The same effect prevails, if the said Ascendant and the 7th are occupied by malefics and be without benefic aspect, or, if the said Ascendant is occupied by Saturn and weak Moon aspected by Mars. Again similar effects shall come to pass, if weak Moon and the Sun are in 12th, Mars in 4th, while Venus is between two malefics. Both the child in the womb and its mother leave this world, if malefics occupy the 4th from the said Ascendant, or from the Moon, while Mars is in the 7th, or Lagna. The same result follows, if Mars is in 4th, Sun in 12th and the Moon be decreasing and be with malefic aspect. If the Sun is in Lagna, while the Moon is weak, or, if Mars is in Lagna, while malefics are in 12th and 2nd without benefics' aspect, death occurs of the mother along with child. The Sun in the 7th at Adhana, while Mars is in Lagna, takes away the child along with its mother through instruments.

42-43. Progress of Pregnancy. Should there be aspects from Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, or the Sun to the Lagna, the process of pregnancy goes on well. The embryo develops according to the state of the Lords of various months (in transit). In the third month the pregnant woman develops tastes to eat various things according to the disposition of the various monthly Lords and Lagna Lord and the Yogas caused to them.

44-45. Time of Delivery. If at the time of Nisheka (i.e. Adhana) the Sun is in a Movable Sign, delivery takes place in the 10th month, if he is in a Fixed Sign, delivery in 11th month is indicated and in a Dual Sign it is in 12th month. If a Movable Rāśi ascends at Adhana, delivery takes place in 10th month, a Fixed 11th and Dual 12th.

46-47. The matter of delivery can be guessed through the Vargas of Nisheka Lagna. The natal Moon can be in the 10th from Adhana Moon. This view is held by many Acharyas. According to Badarayana the natal Ascendant will be in the 7th from Adhana Lagna and natal Moon will be in the 7th from Adhana Moon. Since there are several views on this, I explain below a view, which is acceptable to all.

48. View Acceptable to all about Natal Moon. Note the Dwadasamsa of the Moon at the time of Adhana. When Moon is so many Signs away from her Adhana position (in a month, when delivery is normally possible), delivery will take place.

49. Should a Navāńśa of Saturn rule the Nisheka Lagna and Saturn be in the 7th, the delivery takes place after three years. If Cancer be the Navāńśa Lagna with the Moon in the 7th (from Rāśi Lagna), delivery occurs after twelve years.

50. Fraction of Day, or Night for Delivery. According to Nisheka Lagna being a day Sign, or night Sign, delivery will be after so much of fraction of night, or day having passed.

51-52. Thus should be understood the possible time of birth in day, or night and the Lagna at birth. In similar manner the difference between sunrise and birth, i.e. natal Ascendant and (week)day, fortnight, Muhurta month etc. should be guessed. Such details relating to birth should first be ascertained and then predictions should be issued with reference to nativity by astrologers.

53-55. Yogas for Eye Defects. If at the time of Adhana (or at birth) the Sun and Moon are in Leo identical with Lagna, the child born will be blind. There should be aspect of Mars and Saturn on Leo. A bubble on the eye should be predicted, if Mars and Mercury aspect the said Sun and Moon in Leo Lagna. I shall further explain Yogas affecting the eyes. Should the 12th be occupied by waning Moon, left eye is destroyed and, if by the Sun, it is the right eye. If, however, benefics aspect (the said 12th and the Sun/Moon), then by (suitable) efforts the eye can be repaired.

56. If malefics are in Rāśi Sandhi and the Moon is in Taurus aspected by Mars, Saturn and the Sun, the native born will be dumb. If, however, there is benefic's aspect, the person speaks later on.

57. If malefic planets are in Rāśi Sandhis, while there is no benefic aspect on the Moon, the native born is dullwitted. Should Saturn and Mars be in a Navāńśa of Mercury, the birth is with teeth.

58. Should Mercury be in 5th, or 9th from the Ascendant, while all other planets are devoid of strength, the child has 2 faces, 4 hands and 4 legs.

59. If the last portion of Capricorn rises with aspect from Saturn and the Luminaries, the native is short-statured. The same effect prevails, if the Moon is in Cancer identical with Ascendant and aspected by Mars and Saturn.

60. If Pisces rises at birth with aspect from Mars, Saturn and the Moon, the child born is lame. If there is a benefic's aspect to the said combination, then relief can be expected after making efforts.

61. Should Mars be in the Ascendant and fall in the ascendental decanate, or a trinal decanate, receiving the aspect of malefics, while benefics are devoid of strength, the child in the womb develops no head, no legs and no hands, respectively.

62. Whatever is stated in this Ch., should be suitably applied to natal Ascendant, if applicable. And the rules stated elsewhere in regard to nativity may be used with reference to Ādhāna also, if need be.

Thus ends the 8th Ch. entitled Ādhānādhyāya in Saravali of Kalyana Varma.

Ch. 9. Conditions at Birth
1. To know the time of delivery I have explained the Ādhāna Ch. Now I explain the natal Ch., as below.

2. If natal Lagna is in Sīrshodaya Rāśi, birth is with head foremost and a Prishtodaya Rāśi at birth indicates birth with legs foremost. The birth is with hands in such a position, if an Ubhayodaya Rāśi ascends. Should Lagna enjoy benefic aspect, delivery would have been comfortable, otherwise difficult.

3-4. The place of delivery will correspond to the Rāśi Lagna, or Navāńśa Lagna at birth. If it is a Dual Rāśi, or Navāńśa, delivery will be on the way. A Fixed Rāśi/Ańśa indicates delivery in one's own place. Should the Navāńśa be of the same Rāśi, the delivery is in one's own house, otherwise it is otherwise. The delivery will be in the house of father, or mother according to the indicator concerned being strong.

5-7. If benefic planets are in full, then the birth is in an enclosed place, under a tree, or on the banks of a river. Should all planets be together and not aspect Lagna, or the Moon, then the birth is in a thick forest. If a watery Sign is on the Ascendant and aspected by Full Moon from a watery Sign being 4th, or 10th, birth is in water (river etc.) and similar results be predicted, if Lagna and 4th are occupied by benefics and Full Moon is in watery Sign, or in own House.

8-11. If Scorpio, or Cancer ascends with Saturn and is aspected by Moon, birth is in a deep place. This view is held by Yavanas and Maniththa. Should Saturn be in watery Rāśi rising and aspected by Mercury, birth is in playground. If the planet aspecting is the Sun, it is temple and the Moon aspecting indicates barren lands. Should an Aranya Rāśi (for example Leo) be on the Lagna, the birth is in hills, forest, fortress etc. Should a human Rāśi be ascending and is aspected by Mars, it is burial ground, if by Mercury, sculpture home and, if by the Sun, cowshed, royal palace, or temple. If the aspect is from Venus and Mercury, it indicates pleasing location and, if from Venus and Jupiter, it is Brahmins' place, or where sacred rites are performed.

12. Should Jupiter be exalted in 10th (Libra Lagna), delivery is in a 2-, 3-, or 4-storied building. If benefic planets are in Saturn's Rāśi, or Navāńśa, coinciding with the 4th, or 10th, the delivery is in a veranda, or balcony.

13. To know the direction of the delivery room proceed thus. One of the Dual Signs ascending denotes the quarter (of the direction), in which the room is situated. The other Signs from Aries on indicate the directions of the room.

14. Should there be a (strong) planet in the Angle of a Sign, the direction, represented by that Sign will prevail. If Sagittarius ascends with strength, it is 3-storied building, while Capricorn denotes a spacious house.

15. If Venus is strong at birth, it is a new and painted house. Jupiter in strength denotes a strong house, while Mars indicates a burnt house. The Sun stands for house constructed of wood. It is a new house, if the Moon is strong. Saturn in strength indicates an old house.

16-17. The direction of the planet occupying an Angle denotes the direction of entry for the lying-in-chamber. The planet, that is conjunct with the planet denoting house of birth, indicates the direction, in which another house related to delivery is located. The Sun indicates temples, the Moon watery places, Mars fire-houses, Jupiter treasury, Venus parks etc., Saturn filthy corner and Mercury bedroom etc.

18-20. Now explained is the situation of the cot, on which the delivery took place. The 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th indicate the four legs of cot. The first two relate to southern side legs and the other two denote the northern side legs. If the Ascendant is aspected by a benefic, the kind of cloth relating to that benefic was spread on the delivery cot. The Ascendant leads to know the direction, in which the mother was having her head. The depression in the cot corresponds to the Common Sign occupied by malefics.

21-23. If the Moon is in her debilitation Sign identical with the 4th, or Ascendant, the birth is on the ground. The number of attendants can be known by the number of planets posited between the Moon and Lagna. The number of attendants inside the chamber is known by the number of planets posited in the invisible half and the number of attendants outside the chamber will correspond to the number of planets in the visible half. If the concerned planets are benefic, the attendant ladies are with attractive features, beautiful and bedecked with ornaments. Malefics similarly indicate, that such females are ugly, unfortunate and dirty. If the planets are of mixed disposition, but with strength, the attending women are in between the said two accounts. All these should be accordingly understood.

24-25. Out of the 12 Rāśis the one occupied by the Sun will indicate the portion of the delivery chamber, where light is kept. If it is Fixed Sign, the light burns steadily and, if it is a Moving Sign, it is unsteady. The portion, that expired in Lagna is indicative of the content, to which the wick has burnt already. The quantity of oil in the lamp will correspond to the waxing, or waning state of the Moon.

26-27. There were many lights, if the Sun is aspected by Mars. Should other planets be all weak, light was obtained by burning grass. Should the Moon be in a Navāńśa of Saturn, or be in watery Navāńśa, or in the 4th House and be in aspect to, or in the company of Saturn, delivery was in a place of darkness. There is no doubt about this.

28-30. Should the Ascendant be without the aspect of the Moon, the birth is behind the father, i.e. the father was absent from the place. If the Sun is in the 9th identical with a Movable Rāśi, the father was in a foreign place. The Sun in the case of day birth and Saturn in the case of night birth, if aspected by Mars, delivery is out of father's sight. If the said Sun, or Saturn be in a Movable Sign, death of father (in a distant place) should be declared. If the 5th, 6th and 7th from the Sun are aspected, or occupied by malefics, the father was under confinement. Movable, Fixed and Common Signs here indicate confinement, respectively, in foreign place, own place and on the way.

31. Should the 7th House and the Trines be occupied by malefics, the delivery is not without trouble. Benefics in 10th and 4th cause easy delivery in a large room apart from giving wealth.

32-33. The following lead to birth outside wedlock: Moon, or Lagna sans Jupiter's aspect; Luminaries being together without Jupiter's aspect; Luminaries along with malefics not receiving the aspect of Jupiter; Sun, Moon and Jupiter simultaneously in fall, while Saturn is in Lagna and Lagna, Moon and Venus not being in aspect to Jupiter.

34-36. If the Moon is in 4th, or 7th along with malefics, it is evil to mother. The native's mother dies (immediately after delivery), if there are malefics in 7th from Moon and aspected by Mars. Sun in 10th from the Moon along with malefics indicate death of the mother. The same effect prevails, if Sun is in 5th, or 9th from Venus (?) and with Saturn's company, or aspect. If birth takes place during night-time, while Saturn occupies 5th, or 9th from the Moon, the mother soon leaves the world. For a day birth, if Mars is 5th, or 9th from Venus and aspected by malefics, the mother dies (early).

37-40. If Mars and Saturn join in 5th, or 9th from Ascendant, while the Moon is in 7th, the child is forsaken by the mother. Jupiter's aspect in that case bestows happiness and long life. The child given up dies, if the Moon is in Lagna and Mars in 7th in aspect to malefics. Mars and Saturn in 11th bring similar effects. Should a benefic aspect such combinations, the child is rescued by the respective relative. Both malefics and benefics aspecting indicate death in the hands of others. Saturn and Mars joining in the same Ańśa indicate, that the child will be forsaken by the mother. Mars in 7th from the Ascendant in aspect to Saturn produces similar effects.

41. The child acquires the qualities corresponding to the benefic's aspects. Should the Sun be strong, it resembles the father. If the Moon be so, resemblance is that of the mother.

42. When Leo, Aries, or Taurus rises with Mars, or Saturn, there will be coil around the limb, as indicated by the Navāńśa Lagna Rāśi.

43-44. If the Lagna falls in a decanate of Mars, or Saturn, while malefics, or Moon occupy Lagna, with benefics relegated to 2nd, or 11th denote, that the child was born with navel cord coiled around. Should the Sun be in a Quadruped Sign, while others with strength remain in Dual Signs, it indicates, that twins were born coiled by same navel cord.

45-46. The physical appearance will correspond to the Navāńśa Lagna, or the strongest of planets. It may also correspond to the Lord of the Navāńśa occupied by the Moon. If many are strong, appearance and complexion will be mixed. Race, caste and country of birth should be considered, while estimating features and character of a person.

47. Sages say, that the nature of the native will correspond to the Trimsāńśa occupied by the Sun at birth.

48. Other information must be understood according to the friendship, enmity and debilitation, exaltation, or placement in between of the planets at birth.

49. If weak Moon be with malefics, mother's death takes place, while the Sun being so causes father's death. These planets indicate sickness (to the concerned parent), if aspected by both benefics and malefics. Benefics, however, cause auspiciousness.

50. The Moon, being bright, if be in her exaltation Rāśi, or in her own Rāśi along with Jupiter and Venus in aspect to Mercury, or the Moon in 5th is capable of giving extreme auspiciousness in respect of the native's mother. The Sun so placed proves auspicious for father.

Thus ends the 9th Ch. entitled Janma Vidhanādhyāya of Kalyana Varma's SARAVALI

Ch. 10. Evils at Birth
1. In the absence of knowledge of longevity, attempts to know other information are futile. So I explain below Arishtas (evils) in order to determine longevity.

2. Male planets are strong in odd Rāśis, bright lunar half and day-time. Female planets are strong in even Rāśis, dark lunar half and night-time.

3. There are three kinds of evils, explained by astrological expounders. These are preordained, accidental and Yogaja (arising of planetary combinations). The third kind is dealt with below, while others are explained later on.

4. Should Jupiter be in 8th and in a House of Mars and aspected by Sun, Moon, Mars and Saturn, the child dies in 3 years.

5. If Saturn is retrograde in a House of Mars, while Moon is in 6th, 8th, or an Angle and aspect Mars, the child born lives for two years.

6-7. If Saturn joins Sun and Moon at birth, the life-span is only nine years, according to Brahmasaunda. Should Mars, Sun and Saturn be in Taurus identical with 8th, the native lives for one month even though Lord Yama may try to save him.

8-9. Even, if there be a single malefic in 8th House, owned by Venus and aspected by other malefics, the native lives for one year only in spite of the fact, that he may drink nectar. If Venus is in 12th, 6th, or 8th, owned by Sun, or Moon and is aspected by all benefics, the life-span is six years.

10-11. If Mercury occupies Cancer identical with 6th, or 8th from Ascendant and is aspected by the Moon, life is only up to 4. The efficacious Raja Yogas expounded by Yavanas may produce persons of high descent. Even such children are subject to premature end in this case.

12-13. If the birth star is identical with the one, in which Ketu rises, the native lives only for two months. Should the Sun be in 10th House identical with that of Mars, or Saturn and aspected by strong malefic, the native faces immediate death.

14-15. Should the Ascendant fall in Nigala, Sarpa, Pakshi, or Pasa decanate and be occupied by malefic planets, without the aspect of the decanate Lord concerned, the native lives up to 7 years only. If Rahu is in an Angle and aspected by malefics, the longevity is only 10, while, according to some, it is 16.

16-17. If malefics are Angles and Trines, while benefics are relegated to 6th, 8th and 12th, one born at the time of sunrise dies at once. If the three planets, viz. the Lords of Navāńśa Lagna, Moon Sign and natal Ascendant, are combust, the person lives just for a few years.

18. If the 6th is occupied by the Ascendant Lord, death occurs in the year corresponding to Rāśi concerned. If the occupant is the Lord of rising decanate, death occurs in the month corresponding to Rāśi concerned and, if it is Lord of Navāńśa Lagna, the Rāśi concerned causes death in so many days.

19. If Saturn is in the Ascendant in aspect to malefics, longevity is only 16 days. If Saturn in the Ascendant is in the company of malefics, death occurs in a month and, if he is alone in the Ascendant without malefic connections, the child lives for one year.

20-22. If weak Moon is in the Ascendant excepting Cancer, Taurus and Aries and is aspected by malefics, the child passes away (soon). The Moon in 6th, or 8th, if aspected by malefics, causes death in one year, while, when aspected by benefics, she kills in the 8th year. Should the aspect be from both benefics and malefics, the life-span is only 4. This should be decided according to the strength of such bodies.

23-24. Should benefics be in 6th, or 8th and be aspected, or conjoined with retrograde malefic, without the aspect of benefic, the child lives only for one month. If malefics are in 12th, 2nd, 6th and 8th, without connection of benefics, the child dies in 6, or 8 months.

25-26. If the Lords of Lagna and the Moon Sign are together in 6th, 8th, or 12th and be combust, the child dies in the year corresponding to the Rāśi. Should the Lord of the Ascendant be in 7th, defeated by a malefic and be without a benefic's aspect, death occurs in a month. Similar clues should be drawn from Moon and her dispositor.

27-28. If Moon is conjoined with Mars and Sun and be in 2nd, or 5th unaspected by benefics, the child doubtlessly dies in the 9th year. Sages declare, that, if the Ascendant Lord is in 8th in aspect to all the malefics, who are with strength, the child dies in the fourth month.

29-30. If the Lord of Moon Sign, the Sun and his son are in 8th, the child dies in the year corresponding to the Rāśi concerned. Should the Moon be with malefics, be in 12th, 8th, 6th, or Ascendant and be not aspected by benefics, while benefics are non-angular, the child dies at once.

31-32. If malefics are in the oriental half of the Zodiac (from 10th to 4th Bhava Madhya) with benefics relegated to the occidental half, birth in Scorpio Ascendant causes what is Vajra Mushti Yoga. One born in such a Yoga does hardly live. According to Yavanas, if weak Moon is in Lagna, while malefics are angular, or in 8th, (instant) death is caused.

33-34. One born in twilight does not live long, if the Ascendant falls in lunar Hora, while malefics are posited in the end of the Rāśis, which are angular, along with the Moon. Should the Moon be amidst two malefics and be in 7th, 4th, or 8th, even Gods cannot save one from (instant) death.

35-36. If the Moon is hemmed between two malefics, be in the Ascendant, 7th, or 8th and be in aspect to weak benefics, (infant) death follows. Should malefics be in 7th and 8th and be aspected by malefics, the child dies along with its mother. If there be aspect from benefics in such a case, the mother becomes sick (there will not be immediate death).

37-38. If the Moon be eclipsed and be in the Ascendant along with malefics, while Mars is in 8th, the child quits the world along with its mother. The mother dies of weapons along with the child, if it be a solar eclipse with Sun and malefics in the Ascendant, while Mars is in 8th. Should weak Moon be in the Ascendant and malefics be angular, or in 8th, without benefic's aspect, death is imminent. This view is of Satyācārya.

39-40. The undermentioned combinations cause death soon. Sun in 7th, while Saturn, or Mars is in Ascendant. Sun in Ascendant, while Saturn, or Mars is in 7th. Saturn, or Mars joining Moon and she not aspected by benefics. Malefics in Ascendant, 8th, 7th, 4th and 10th, the Moon be decreasing in 12th.

41-42. Moon, Sun, Saturn and Mars are capable of inflicting infant death, if they are together in Ascendant, 12th, 9th, or 8th, unaspected by Jupiter. If Ascendant is tenanted by Sun, or Moon, while malefics are in Trines, or 8th and be not aspected by, or conjoined with benefics, according to Yavanas, infant death is caused.

43-44. Venus joining the Sun and Saturn causes instant death. This combination doubtlessly gives death in the 9th year, if aspected by Jupiter. Death in childhood occurs, if Moon is conjoined with Mars, Sun and Saturn, provided unaspected by benefic planets.

45-46. If Sun is aspected by Mars and Saturn in the case of a day birth, it soon leads to death of the father. The Sun joining malefics (for day birth) also indicates the same effect. The child's father and paternal grandfather will face early death, if Sun is in Ascendant along with Mars and Saturn, but unrelated to Mercury, Jupiter and Venus.

47-48. If Sun is hemmed between two malefics, or is conjoined with malefics, one born during day-time loses his father early without any doubt. The child's father at once quits the world, if planet Sun has Mars and Saturn in 8th from him unaspected by benefics.

49-50. If at birth Sun is in a Movable Rāśi along with malefics, the father of the child dies of poison, weapons etc. Malefics (or even a malefic) in 8th, 9th, or 7th from Moon can cause death of the child along with its mother.

51-52. The father of the child was away at the time of birth, if Sun is in a Movable Sign, in case of day birth and aspected by Mars. Saturn in a Movable Rāśi and in aspect to the Sun in the case of night birth denotes same results.

53-54. In the case of night birth, if Saturn is in a Movable Sign along with Mars, the father undoubtedly dies in a distant place. If Sun joins Mars and Saturn in any Rāśi, the father dies before the birth of the native.

55-56. If malefics are disposed in Ascendant, 8th, 7th, 6th and 12th, the child dies along with its mother. There is no doubt in it. Should only 6th and 8th be occupied by malefics, the mother does not die, but the child dies. The reverse is true, if malefics are in Ascendant, 8th and 7th.

57-67. Mars, or Saturn in 12th can deprive the native of his eyes. Saturn right and Mars left eye. The native becomes blind, if Sun and Moon are in 12th, while 6th and 8th are occupied by malefics. Even, if one among the Sun and the Moon is in 12th, damage to eye is indicated (Sun affects the right eye, while Moon affects the left one). If Rahu is in Ascendant, while Sun is in 7th, the native is blind by birth. Should 2nd and 12th be occupied by Moon and Sun, while malefics are in 8th and 6th, the person born is blind. If Moon is in 6th, Sun in 8th, Saturn in 9th and Mars in 2nd, simultaneously, the native is blind. Should Moon be in the company of Mars and Saturn and be posited in 8th, or 6th, the native looses his eyesight due to bilious and phlegmatic imbalances. Should the said Moon be conjunct other malefics, apart from Mars and Saturn, in this combination, if the House involving Moon is the 8th, the damage is to the right eye and, if it be the 6th, the left eye is damaged. Should, however, this combination be aspected by benefics, the damage is not at birth, but will be later on. If Moon is in 8th, or 12th along with Saturn and be aspected by malefics, eyesight is lost due to windy and phlegmatic complaints (here also 8th indicates right, while 12th the left eye). And, if benefics aspect the said Moon in 8th/12th, the loss is not at birth, but in the course of time. If Moon is thus associated with Saturn and Sun (in several ways), damage to eyes is to be predicted.

68-70. YOGAS ADVERSE FOR EARS. Moon in 11th, 3rd, or Ascendant along with malefics causes defects of the ears. If she is aspected by malefics, the effect is along with birth (i.e. immediate). Should 9th and 5th be aspected, or occupied by malefics, ear defects at the time of birth exist. Malefics in 9th affect the right ear, while in 5th they damage the left ear. Benefics aspecting, or occupying these Houses cause on the other hand good in respect of ears.

71-73. Whatever Rāśi is indicative of a disease shall be treated, as the limb to be afflicted by such disease. The Moon Sign can also be similarly considered. Benefics cause birth marks on the right, or left side of the body, according to their occupation. Should malefics aspect these benefics, loss of concerned limb should be expected. Malefics and benefics according to their association with Moon and the visible and invisible halves (counted from Lagna) cause bad and good results in this respect.

74-76. DEATH IN FEW DAYS. The Sun and the Moon in the 3rd House identical with Pisces cause illness from birth and the child lives only for three days. If the Moon is in the 10th from the Ascendant, while the Sun singly, or with all others is in the 3rd asterism from that occupied by the Moon, the child lives only for one night. The life span is just one week, if the Sun and Mars are in the 7th from the Moon.

77-82. EFFECTS OF TIME OF STARTING OF DISEASES. The following combinations prevailing at the time of a disease cause death in so many days, as indicated: 1) Malefics in 4th and 8th from Lagna-10 days. 2) Malefics in 2nd and 12th from Lagna10 days. 3) The Sun in 5th, while Moon is in 9th from the Ascendant12 days. 4) The Moon in Angle, while the Sun is in 4th, or 8th 3 nights. 5) The Moon in the 4th, while the Sun is in the 6th 18 days. 6) The Sun in the 5th, or 9th from the Moon20 days. 7) The Sun in the Ascendant, or the 8th and in aspect to Saturn and Mars will finally inflict death on the patient.

83-88. Mars in Lagna, or other Angles, while Jupiter is not so causes death. The Sun in Lagna, Jupiter non angular and malefics in the 8th cause immediate death. Similar results should be predicted, if the Moon is in the Ascendant, while Jupiter is in a place other than Angles and malefics are in the 8th. Malefics in the 7th from the rising decanate, while the Moon is in the Ascendant will also cause death at birth. (In this case, the Moon shall be in the rising decanate, while malefics shall occupy the l9th decanate). A majority of planets in the 8thprimarily maleficsindicate longevity ranging from seven days to one month. A dead child is born, if Saturn is in the Ascendant, while Mars is in the 8th, with Jupiter being not in an Angle.

89-9O. MALEFICS IN RISING DECANATE AND TRINES THEREOF. Saturn in the rising decanate, while a malefic is in the 5th and another in the 9ththe latter two should be exactly on trinal decanates, as Saturn isindicates disease. Mars in the place of Saturn in the said combination denotes (infant) death, while the Sun so placed indicates disease, deformity, or death.

91. DEATH. If at birth Mars is in the Ascendant, while Venus is in an Angle, Mars causes death, when he resumes the same point in the next round in his transit.

92. If Jupiter is in a Trine, Ascendant Lord in the Ascendant and Mars in an Angle to one of them, it can cause immediate death.

93-97. EXCEEDINGLY LONG LIFE. The native lives for 108 years, if the 8th House is not occupied, while Ascendant is free from malefic residence and Jupiter is in an Angle. A span of over 108 years is granted, if Jupiter and Venus are in an Angle, while there are no malefics in Trines and the 8th. Predict 120 years of life, if Venus is in the Ascendant, Jupiter is in an Angle other than the Ascendant and the 8th House is not occupied by malefics. Similar span of life is given, if Jupiter is in Cancer Ascendant along with Venus, or the Moon, while the 8th House is not occupied. If Angles, Trines and the 8th House are not occupied by malefics, one's longevity is comparable to that of Gods.

98. ELAPSED LONGEVITY. Weak Moon along with malefics, if posited in the 8th, 7th, 12th, 1st, 5th, or 9th and unaspected by benefics will only grant elapsed longevity, i.e. immediate death.

99. TIMING INFANT DEATH. When the child with powerful infant mortal combinations is in its first year, death will come to pass, if the Moon with strength passes over the natal position of another qualified planet, or on its own natal position (i.e. Janma Rāśi), or natal Ascendant. In all these cases, the Moon should be aspected by malefics.

100-103. DEATH IN CHILDHOOD. Any one group of the following planets joining in one House will cause death in five years: d) The Sun, the Moon, Mars and Jupiter, 2) Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and the Moon, 3) The Sun, Saturn, Mars and the Moon. Even, if a child is on the God's laps, it will die in 11th year, if the Sun conjunct Mercury is aspected by malefics. Death within 7 years of age will occur, if the Sun is in the Ascendant along with Mars and Saturn, while declining Moon is in the 7th House in a House owned by Venus, provided this combination is not aspected by Jupiter. Should the Sun and the declining Moon be in Angles and be conjunct with, or in aspect to Mars and Saturn, the child has a longevity of only 4 years. In these cases, i.e., where child mortality is indicated, there is no use of making any calculations.

104. DEATH IN THIRD YEAR. If waning Moon, or Lagna Lord be in the Marana Pada and aspected by all the malefics, but not benefics, the length of life is only 3 years.

Notes: Marana Pada has been interpreted, as 8th House by some. But it actually means the Rāśi counted so many Signs away from the Rāśi, in which the 8th Lord is, as he is away from the 8th. Note how many Signs away the 8th Lord is from the 8th. So many Rāśis away from the 8th Lord's Rāśi is Marana Pada.

105-107. If all benefic planets are in the visible half of the Zodiac, while malefics are relegated the invisible half Rahu be specifically in the Ascendantat the time of birth, the longevity is only 3 years. Should Rahu be in the 7th House in exclusive aspect to the Luminaries and be unaspected by others, death before the age of 12 is denoted.

108-110. If Rahu is in Aquarius, Leo, or Scorpio identical with the Ascendant and is aspected by malefics, the life span is only 7. If Dhuma Ketu rises followed by fall of meteor and strong gale and, if birth occurs in Raudra Muhurta, or Sarpa Muhurta, the subject invites early death.

111-114. FATEFUL DEGREES OF THE MOON. The Moon is capable of inflicting death, if she is in any of the following degrees at birth: Aquarius 21, Leo 5, Taurus 9, Scorpio 23, Aries 8, Cancer 12, Libra 4, Capricorn 20, Virgo 1, Sagittarius 18, Pisces 10 and Gemini 22. If the Moon is in such degrees at birth, death is indicated in the corresponding year and the native cannot be protected by even God Yama.

115-118. Assess the strengths of Ascendant, Angles etc., at birth. Jupiter is life spirit of all natives. The time of death should be known through Jupiter. If he is in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 9th, 10th and 11th, or Ascendant, he proves fatal at the age of 5 10, 46, 20. 30, 40 and 50, respectively.

Thus ends the 10th Ch. entitled Evils at Birth in Kalyana Varma's SARAVALI

Ch. 11. Evils and the Moon
1-2. I now explain the combinations, that are capable of nullifying the said evils, for these are important in the Science of Horoscopy and initially explained below are the Yogas to counteract the evils emanating from, or afflicting the Moon, as done by expounders, like Lord Brahma.

3-4. If the Moon is Full and is aspected by all heavenly bodies, all evils are countered, just as lawbreakers are destroyed by the king. Venus aspecting the Full Moon, while the latter is in friendly divisions is capable of obstructing evils, just as abdominal remedies are able to cure windy diseases.

5-6. Should the Moon be in her deep exaltation and be aspected by Venus, evils are countered, just as phlegm and bile are controlled by induced vomiting. If the Moon be in the divisions of benefic planets and be aspected by benefics, she will not prove evil though she may be waning, just as nutmeg bark treats dysentery.

7-8. Benefics in the 7th, 8th and 6th from the Moon remove all adversities, just as madness is removed by Kalyana Grita. Same is the case, if the Moon is conjunct benefics and be in the decanates owned by benefics, just as saline water controls ear diseases.

9-10. Should the full Moon be in a benefic's Dwadasamsa, all evils are removed, just as butter-milk checks piles. If the Moon occupies a benefic's Rāśi and receives the Lagna Lord's aspect, adversities for short-life are counteracted, as even a noble housewife can destroy the fame of the descent, if she seeks union with other men.

11-12. Even though the Moon may be in a House owned by a malefic, or in such Vargas, she does not prove evil, if aspected by her dispositor. This is comparable-to a miser protecting his money. If the dispositor of the Moon is strong and be in aspect to benefics, or friendly planets, the Moon is not capable of harming, in comparison to a timid person, who cannot face others even though he may be in war field.

13-14. If the Lord of the Moon Sign is in Lagna and is aspected by all planets, all evils are removed, just as the ointment of holy fig and bamboo bark removes whiteness. The Moon in her exaltation, own, friendly, or benefic Vargas, aspected by benefics, but not malefics counteracts all-evils, as the Sun does remove fog.

15. Just as quartan fever is removed by inhaling Agashya flower, all evils are checked by Mercury and Venus in the 12th of Moon, malefics in the 11th and Jupiter in the 10th.

16-17. Should the Moon be in the 6th, 3rd, 10th, 11th, or 4th from the natal Ascendant and be aspected by benefics, evils are removed, as though a king destroys his opponents. The Lord of the Moon Sign is singly capable of removing all evils, if he is with full strength and aspected by benefics, similar to an inebriated tiger throwing away a thousand deer.

Thus ends the 11th Ch., entitled “Evils and the Moon” in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Ch. 12. Evils Canceled at Birth
1. A very brilliant Jupiter (i.e. not being devoid of rays) is capable of counteracting all evils, if he is in the Ascendant, just as a single sincere Prostration before Lord Vishnu, the wearer of Sudarshana Chakra, relieves one of the greatest sins.

2. Benefics with strength and malefics without it remove all evils, if Ascendant falls in a benefic's House and is aspected by benefics, just as those, who worship planets will have no sins left to their liability.

3-5. If malefics occupy the Rāśis and Amsas of benefics (i.e. such benefic divisions) and be in aspect to benefics, evils are removed, just as a dejected lady remains away from her husband. Should Rahu be in the 3rd, 6th, or 11th from the Ascendant and be aspected by benefics all evils are destroyed, as though wind carries away a heap of cotton with it. If all planets be in direct motion and in Seershodaya Signs, all blemishes are removed, just as ghee is burnt out in fire.

6-7. A benefic planet victorious in planetary war at birth and essentially aspected by another benefic, destroys all evils, just as a gale can uproot trees. If a planet has a halo (in the sky) and is aspected by a malefic, evils are countered, just as the solar eclipse day bath in Kurukshetra does.

8-9. If there is a pleasant breeze at the time of birth and the sky is with pleasing clouds and the heavenly bodies be with splendour, the evils disappear in a fillip, just as rains settle dust. If birth takes place, when Agasthya and others of Saptharshis (Alfa Carini, or Great Bear) rise, all evils are destroyed, just as darkness disappears, when the Sun rises.

10-11. Rahu in the Ascendant identical with Aries, Taurus, or Cancer protects the native from the clutches of all evils, just as a pleased king forgives the crimes of a person. If all the planets (not of course the nodes) arc in their own decanates, all evils are removed, just as the Sun removes darkness.

12. If at birth many planets are capable of giving benefic results, even then there is no blemish, just as the king gets success in journey undertaken, when the Moon is in a Trine to the Sun.

13. Should Jupiter and Venus be in Angles, evils arising out of the various Rāśis (i.e. Bhavas) and of the Moon are countered. And the native lives for hundred years.

14. If Jupiter and the Moon be in Cancer, identical with 4th, 10th, or the Ascendant, Mercury and Saturn be in Libra, while others are in the 11th, 3rd and 6th, one has illimitable longevity.

15. I have thus explained the Yogas, that are capable of countering the evils, as laid down by our great ancestors May the astrologers please the king with the knowledge of these.

Thus ends the 12th Ch. entitled “Cancellation of evils at birth” in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Ch. 13. Lunar Yogas
1. SUNAPHA, ANAPHA AND DURUDHURA YOGAS. Excepting the Sun, any other planet in the 2nd from the Moon causes Sunapha Yoga, in the 12th Anapha Yoga and in both the 2nd and the 12th Durudhura Yoga.

2. KEMADRUMA YOGA. Kemadruma Yoga is formed, if at least one of the said three Yogas (viz. Sunapha, Anapha and Durudhura Yogas) is not present, or, if the Moon's Angles are devoid of planets, or, if she is unaspected by all the planets. Such Yoga causes extreme difficulties.

3. DIFFERENT PERMUTATIONS. By all possible permutations and transmutations, one can see 30 kinds of Sunapha Yoga, 30 kinds of Anapha Yoga and 180 kinds of Durudhura Yoga.

4. EFFECTS OF SUNAPHA YOGA. One born with Sunapha Yoga will be wealthy, will have self-made prowess (or will reach an exalted position of his own efforts), be very virtuous, be learned in Shastras and their meanings, be very famous, virtuous (like Lord Rama), be peacefully disposed, happy, be a king, or a minister and be highly intelligent.

5. EFFECTS OF ANAPHA YOGA. One born in Anapha Yoga will be eloquent in speech, magnanimous, virtuous, will enjoy food, drink, flowers, robes and females, will be famous, calm in disposition, happy, pleased and will possess a beautiful body.

7. EFFECTS OF KEMADRUMA YOGA. The native with Kemadruma Yoga will be deprived of life, drinks, food, residence, robes and friends, though he may belong to regal scion. He will suffer from poverty, grief, sickness and be dirty. He will live by hard labor, be wicked and be inimically disposed to one and all.

8-9. OTHER KIND OF SUNAPHA ETC. The kind of Sunapha Yoga etc. arising from the Moon's Angles are (also) important. These Yogas give effects according to the state of the Moon (i.e. depending on her rays, being Full, New etc.). The strength of the planets, viz. Mars etc., causing these Yogas, native's country and the race he belongs to must be properly understood before evaluating Sunapha etc.

10-11. RESULTS OF SUCH YOGAS CAUSED BY MARS ETC. If Sunapha Yoga is caused by Mars (by being in the 2nd of the Moon), the native will be valorous, wealthy, cruel in speech, be an Army chief, will be fierce, torturous, proud and inimical. If Mercury be the cause of Sunapha Yoga, the native will be expert in Vedas, Shastras and music. He will be virtuous and a poet. He will be high-minded, intent on thinking of good for all and will possess a brilliant physique.

12-14. Should Jupiter cause Sunapha Yoga, a person so born will have high learning, will be famous and himself be a king, or dear to a king. He will have a good family and have plenty of wealth. Venus will give wife, lands, wealth, prowess, quadrupeds and valour. The native will further be honoured by king and will also be courageous. Should Saturn be in the 2nd of the Moon causing Sunapha Yoga, the native will be skillful, be worshipped by the people in his village and city and will have wealth galore. He will be devoted to his work and be brave.

15-19. ANAPHA YOGA'S EFFECTS GIVEN BY MARS ETC. If Anapha Yoga is caused by Mars-being in the 12th from the Moonthe native will head a band of thieves, will be arrogant in disposition, be honoured, fond of war, given to anger, good, praiseworthy, good-bodied and proud. If by Mercury, the native will be an expert in singing, dancing and writing, will be a poet and an able orator. He will be conferred honours by tile ruler. will have a brilliant body and will perform famous deeds. Should the Yoga be caused by Jupiter, the native will be majestic, strong, intelligent, fond of assembly, famous through a king and will be a poet. Venus causing this Yoga gives an exceedingly great liking for women. The native will be dear to the king and will enjoy pleasures. He will be splendourous, famous and will have abundant gold. If Saturn causes this Yoga, the subject will be broad-shouldered, be a leader, be indired to keep up his commitments, be rich with quadrupeds, devoted to an infamous lady and be virtuous.

20. EFFECTS OF DURUDHURA YOGA CAUSED BY MARS ETC. If Durudhura Yoga is caused by the pair of Mars and Mercury, the native will be a liar, be very wealthy, expert, very wicked, greatly miserly, addicted to an old lady and be chief in his race.

21. If durudhura Yoga is caused by Mars and Jupiter, one will be famous by his deeds, be mighty (or wealthy), inimically disposed to many and disposed to anger, will protect his men and will gather money.

22. If the Moon has Venus and Mars on either side, the native will have a virtuous wife, will be fortunate, argumentative, pure, skillful, will like doing exercises and be bold in war.

23. If Saturn and Mars plank the Moon, the native will be the husband of a bad lady. He will save a lot of money. He will have vices. He will be given to anger and be a tale bearer. He will win over his enemies.

24. Should Jupiter and Mercury be on either side of the Moon, the native will be virtuous, learned in Shastras, garrulous, be a good poet, be wealthy, capable of making sacrifices and be famous.

25. If Durudhura Yoga is caused by Mercury and Venus, the person will be a sweet speaker, be fortunate, splendourous, beautiful, be fond of dance, singing etc., be served, valiant and be a minister.

26. If Mercury and Saturn plank the Moon, the native will move from one country to the other to earn money. He will not be much educated, will be worshipped by others, but be inimical to his own men.

27. Should Jupiter and Venus cause this Yoga, by being on either side of the Moon, the native will be courageous, intelligent, will have political wisdom, will possess gold and gems, will be famous and be in the employ of a king.

28.1f Jupiter and Saturn be such planets, as to cause Durudhura Yoga the native will be happy, will have knowledge of politics, will be sweet in speech, learned, peaceful, wealthy and good looking.

29. One, who has Durudhura Yoga caused by Venus and Saturn will conduct himself, like an old man (i.e. so mature), be chief in his race, skillful, dear to women and will have plenty of money. He will be honoured by the king and gather abundant wealth.

30. LUNAR YOGAS FROM THE SUN. If the Moon is in an Angle from the Sun, little effects will be felt in regard to money, wisdom, skill, learning and modesty. These are medium, if the Moon be in Panaphara (i.e. 2nd 5th, 8th and 11th) and exceedingly good in Apoklima (i.e. 3rd, 6th. 9th and 12th).

31. MOON IN VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE HALVES. In the case of a night birth, if the Moon is with Parivesha (halo) and be declining in the invisible half of the Zodiac (i.e. being posited between Lagna Bhava Madhya and the center of the descendant7th House), or declining Moon in day time be in the visible half (i.e. between the centres of the descendant and the Ascendant), even results will be felt in respect of fear, grief etc., (that is these positions confer bad results). The Full Moon gives kingdom, if she be contrarily posited.

32. DHANA YOGAS. If all benefics are posited in Upachayas i.e. 3, 6, 10 and 11, the native will acquire much wealth. Two benefics confer moderate wealth, while one confers little wealth in the said Upachaya. These can be deduced from the Moon also.

33. There are other Raja Yogas, like Adhi Yoga arising from the Moon. I have not dealt with them here which I have done infra.

Thus ends the 13th Ch. entitled “Yogas from the Moon” in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Ch. 14. Yogas from the Sun
1. VASI, VESI, UBHAYACHARI YOGAS FROM THE SUN. Excluding the Moon (and nodes) a planet in the 12th from the Sun causes Vasi Yoga, in the 2nd Vesi Yoga and in both the 12th and the 2nd Ubhayachari Yoga.

2. RESULTS OF VESI YOGA. One born in Vesi Yoga will be weak-sighted, firm in his word, be hard working and will have a bent body. So say Yavanas.

3-5. EFFECTS OF VESI YOGA CAUSED BY DIFFERENT PLANETS. Should Jupiter cause Vesi Yoga, the native will accumulate money, be learned and be good-hearted. If Venus produces this Yoga, the person will be timid, will face obstacles in his missions, will have pleasant (or swift) movements and will be defeated. Mercury causing this Yoga indicates, that the native will be a servant, will suffer penury, be soft-spoken and be modest. He will be bashful. Mars denotes, that the native will resort to base means, but be helpful to others. If it is Saturn, that causes Vesi Yoga, one will join others' wives, be wicked, will resemble an old person in appearance,-be fraudulent in disposition and be contemptuous. He will, however, have wealth.

6. EFFECTS OF VASI YOGA. One born in Vasi Yoga will possess excellent speech (voice), good memory, be employed, will have looks towards, sideways, will possess a strong physique about the waist, will be equal to a king and be a genuine person.

In the case of Venus, the person will be valorous, famous, virtuous and reputed. Mercury emanating this Yoga will make one speak sweetly, be beautiful and obey others' orders. The Vasi Yoga caused by Mars indicates, that the subject will be victorious in war, famous and will live with his own fortunes. If by Saturn, the native will be a businessman, wicked, will steal others' money, will hate elders and will be the husband of a pious lady.

10. The strength of the planet Sun and that of the planets causing these Yogas and their association with various Rāśis and Amsas should be understood and all results be declared accordingly.

11. EFFECTS OF UBHAYACHARI YOGA. One born under Ubhayachari Yoga will have forebearance, will be very fortunate, even bodied, firm, profoundly strong, not very tall, full of everything, learned, happy, will have many servants, will protect his relatives, be equal to a king, ever enthusiastic and will enjoy all pleasures.

Benefics in the place of malefics in the said Yogas will prove auspicious to the respective parent. If the planets joining be of mixed nature (i.e. one benefic and another malefic), the effects are medium.

Ch. 20. Combinations For Renunciation
1. Various sages have explained widely the combinations of four, or more planets producing an ascetic. I now explain below such of the Yogas.

2. One born with the conjunction of the Sun, the Moon, Venus, Jupiter and Mars; or the Luminaries, Mercury and Mars; or the Sun, Mars, Saturn, Mercury and Venus becomes an ascetic.

3. The native having the combination of Mars, the Luminaries (i.e. the Sun and the Moon), Mercury and Jupiter; or the Luminaries, Saturn and Mercury; or the Luminaries, Mars and Saturn takes to renunciation and become a mendicant.

4. The Sun, Jupiter, Saturn and Mercury-being together, or Mars, the Sun, Mercury and Jupiter joining denotes a mendicant.

5. Should Venus, the Sun, Mars and Saturn; or Jupiter, Mars, the Sun and Saturn; or Mars, the Moon, Jupiter and Saturn with strength be in conjunction at birth, native takes to asceticism.

6. One will be initiated into a religious vow, if anyone of the following group of planets be found together at birth: d) Mars. Saturn, Mercury and Jupiter; 2) Mars, Saturn Mercury, the Sun and Venus; 3) the Luminaries, Mars Saturn and Venus.

7. One becomes a mendicant to live in forests and hilly areas, if the planets group themselves in conjunction at birth, as under: 1) Venus, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter and the Sun; 2) Mars, the Moon, Jupiter, Mercury and Saturn; 3) Venus, Mercury, Saturn, the Moon and Mars.

8. The native will become a sage, giving up (even) his food and be honoured by the people, if the heavenly bodies form conjunction, as under: 1) The Moon, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and the Sun; 2) The Luminaries, Mercury, Venus and Mars.

9. The native will be initiated into a religious vow, if 1) the Luminaries, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn, or 2) The Moon, Mars, Saturn, Mercury, Jupiter and the Sun, or 3) Mars, the Luminaries, Saturn, Venus and Mercury, join together at birth.

10. A famous sage is indicated by the combination of 1) the Luminaries, Jupiter, Saturn and Venus, or 2) Venus, the Luminaries, Jupiter, Saturn and Mercury.

11. Note the conjunction of the following planets: 1) Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and the Sun. 2) Venus, the Luminaries, Saturn, Jupiter and Mercury. It indicates an ascetic.

12. If conjunction is found among the planetary group, viz. 1) the Luminaries, Jupiter and Saturn; 2) Saturn, the Luminaries and Venus; 3) Sun, Mercury, Mars and Jupiter, the native will become an ascetic living on roots and fruits.

13. The native will become an ascetic with bark garments, if Mars, the Sun, Mercury and Venus are found together at birth. The same effect follows the conjunction of Mars, the Moon, Jupiter and Mercury.

14. A patient ascetic (awaiting the blessing of the Supreme) is indicated by either the combination of the Moon, Mercury, Mars and Saturn, or of Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

15. A sage living only by eating fruits is denoted by the combination of the Luminaries, Venus and Mercury; or Mars, Mercury, Venus and Saturn; or Saturn, the Moon, Jupiter and Venus.

16. An ascetic, who will be highly honourable, living in forests, is denoted by each of the under mentioned planetary conjunctions: 1) The Sun, Mars, the Moon and Venus, 2) the Luminaries, Mars and Mercury, 3) Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and the Sun, 4) Venus, Jupiter, the Moon and Mars.

17. Find the planets together in individual groups, as under 1) Venus, Moon, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, 2) the Moon, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Venus, 3) The Luminaries, Mars, Mercury and Jupiter. The result is, that the ascetic will be sorrowful (Unsuccessful mendicant).

18. Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, Venus and Mercury with strength, or Saturn, the Sun, Mercury, the Moon and Mars with strength in conjunction produce one with clotted hair and bark-garments.

19. The Luminaries, Mercury, Mars and Venus, or the Luminaries, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, if be together, the native certainly will become an ascetic.

20. If the Sun denotes asceticism (i.e. being the strongest in the Yoga), there will only be faith in the religious order, while competence (to fulfill the order) will lack. If the planet, contributing to such order is overpowered by another planet (i.e. in eclipse, planetary war etc.) the native will give up the order after being initiated into it. Should many planets denote such an order, there may be many kinds of religious orders, but these will depend on the order of the planet.

21. If the planet indicating asceticism is combust in the Sun, or is aspected by another heavenly body, the native will only have an earnest desire to be initiated into the religious order, but will not attain fruition of his aim. So say Yavanas.

22. The native will attain religious order, if the Moon, posited in a decanate of Saturn, is aspected by Mars and Saturn. The same effect is produced, if the Moon occupies the Navāńśa of Aries/Scorpio in aspect to Saturn.

23. If the Lord of the Moon Sign receives the sole aspect of Saturn (i.e. unaspected by others than Saturn), one will enter religious order. Even in this context, the earlier Yogas, if present will only prevail.

24. If the Lord of the Moon Sign, bright with rays, lends his aspect to Saturn, while Saturn is in an Angle, the native will lose his fortunes only to enter into a religious order.

25. If one among the Sun, the Moon and Jupiter be devoid of strength and occupy the Ascendant, or the 10th, or the 12th in aspect to strong Saturn, the native will become distressed ascetic.

26. Should the Moon with strength be in the 10th, falling in a benefic's Navāńśa, while others occupy their exaltation marks and all being in aspect to strong Saturn, the native will become the Lord of the earth to only become an ascetic.

27. If waxing Moon, with superior strength, aspects the Ascendant Lord, the latter being bereft of strength and being alone (in that Rāśi), the native will be devoid of wealth and own men, be miserable, sorrowful, will take to asceticism and will obtain his food with great inconvenience.

28. One will become a religious mendicant, if Saturn occupying a benefic's Navāńśa aspects others including the Moon. The Moon in this case should only be in Aquarius Navāńśa.

29. If the Lord of the Moon Sign aspects all the other planets, while these are all together in one Rāśi, the native will become an ascetic.

30. The Sun rules the ascetics of the following orders: Those, who worship the Fire God in forests, or on river banks, those, who worship (the omnipotent) Sun-God, Elephant-faced Ganesa and His benevolent mother Parvati, those, who recite the hymns of Gayatri (which are very sacred), those, who are vowed to bathe in the sacred Ganges everyday and those, who maintain (absolute) celibacy.

31. The religious order belonging to the Moon attracts the following various persons: Those disciples, who smear their bodies with sacred ashes, those, who worship the Feet of Lord Shiva, those, who are abandoned by the society, those, who are devoted to Bhagavati, those, who give up company of others, those, who take to Soma Siddhanta and those, who carry bowls in their hands (for begging alms).

32. The Buddhist monks, the tonsured, those, who wear white apparels, those, who beg wearing good robes, those, who wear blood-red clothes and those, that have conquered their five senses-all these mendicants are ruled by Mars.

33. Mercury denotes an alm-seeker, a conjurer, a snake poison curer and one, who eats the flesh of a peacock.

34. The ascetics ruled by Jupiter are: those, who hold a single scepter (or mace), those, who hold three scepters, those, who wear red coloured apparels, those, who are in the third stage of their religious life, those, who pull on their lives with fruits and water (alone), those, who still are attached to family ties, those, who maintain celibacy and those, who take to visiting shrines etc.

35. Venus rules the mendicants of Saivite and Vaish-navite sects.

36. Religious hypocrites, bare mendicants and the ascetics, who sit under shadowy trees in forests are ruled by Saturn.

37. Should Raja Yogas be simultaneously present along with the above ascetic Yogas, all the evil results are nullified and the native will become very virtuous, will be adorned by all the kings. himself becoming a king and will take to religious order.

Thus ends the 20th Ch., entitled ‘Combinations for Renunciation' in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Ch. 21. Nabhasa Yogas
1. NABHASA YOGAS. Yavanas have explained 1800 kinds of Nabhasa Yogas, out of which I detail below 32.

2-4. KINDS OF NABHASA YOGA. The following are the 32 Nabhasa Yogas Nau, Chatra, Koota, Chaapa, Sringataka, Vajra, Damini, Pasa, Veena, Kamala, Musala, Vapi, Hala, Sara, Samudra, Chakra, Maala. Sarpa, Ardha Chandra, Yava, Kedara, Gada, Pakshi, Yupa, Yuga, Sakata, Soola, Danda, Rajju, Sakthi, Nala and Gola. The Asraya Yogas, viz. Musala, Rajju and Nala are dealt with by Acharya Manitha.

5-6. Gola, Yuga, Soola, Pasa, Veena (Vallaki), Kedara and Damini arc the seven Sankhya Yogas. The two Dala Yogas viz. Sarpa (Bhujanga) and Mala are explained by Parasara Maharishi. Savitracharya dealt with remaining 20 Yogas.

7. One born with an Asraya will obtain the good effects, viz., happiness, advantages and qualities, provided there is no other kind of (Nabhasa) Yoga present in the horoscope. If other (Nabhasa) Yoga is present in addition to an Asraya Yoga, then the effects of Asraya Yoga do not come to pass, but the other (Nabhasa) Yoga prevails.

8-10. EFFECT OF AKRITI, SANKHYA AND DALA YOGAS. One born in Akriti Yoga will be satisfied with his own fortunes, will earn through a king, be dear to king and be famous. Should there be a Sankhya Yoga, the native will be happy only with others' wealth, will live only through others help and be always not peaceful. A native with Dala Yoga will sometimes enjoy his own fortune, yet sometimes that of others, will pick up the fruits thrown on the ground by others, be sometimes happy and sometimes sorrowful.

11. NAUKA, KOOTA, CHATRA AND CHAPA YOGAS. If the seven planets occupy continuous Houses starting from the Ascendant and the other three Angles, Yogas called Nauka, Koota, Chatra and Chapa are, respectively, formed.

12. YUPA, SARA, SAKTHI AND DANDA YOGAS. If the seven planets occupy for continuous Houses counted from the Ascendant and its Angles, the resultant Yogas are known, as Yupa, Sara (or Ishu-arrow), Sakthi and Danda, respectively.

13. ARDHA CHANDRA AND GADA YOGAS. If the seven planets occupy continuously seven Houses commencing from a House, which is not angular to the Ascendant, the Yoga produced is known, as Ardha Chandra (Ardha Sasi) Yoga. Gada Yoga forms, when all the seven planets occupy two successive Angles from the Ascendant.

14. VAJRA, YAVA, PADMA AND VAPI YOGAS. If benefics occupy the Lagna and 7th, while malefics are in the 4th and 10th Vajra Yoga is formed. Conversely, if malefics are in the Lagna and 7th, while 4th and 10th are occupied by benefics, Yava Yoga is produced. If all the planets are disposed in four kendras, Padma (Kamala) Yoga is formed. Should the seven planets be relegated either to Apoklima Houses (3, 6, 9 and 12th), or to Panapharas (2, 5, 8 and 11 Houses), Vapi Yoga is formed.

15. SAKATA, VIHAGA, HALA AND SRINGATAKA YOGAS. If all planets occupy only the Ascendant and the 7th House, Sakata Yoga is formed. Similar participation of all the planets in the 4th and 10th Houses constitutes Vihaga (Pakshi) Yoga. Should all the planets be in mutual Trines, avoiding the Ascendant, Hala Yoga is formed. All planets relegated only to the Ascendant and its Trines give rise to Sringataka Yoga.

16. CHAKRA AND SAMUDRA YOGAS. Should all the planets occupy alternative Rāśis commencing from the Lagna, Chakra Yoga is formed. If these occupy alternative Rāśis from the 2nd onwards, Samudra Yoga is formed.

17. Thus, I have explained the twenty different Akriti Yogas. Now, I explain the Asraya Yogas, as per the schools of thought of senior Garga etc.

18. ASRAYA AND DALA YOGAS. Should all the planets be in Dual Rāśis, Nala Yoga is formed. Similarly, if these are in Fixed Rāśis, Musala Yoga takes place and in Movable Rāśis Rajju Yoga is formed. All Angles occupied exclusively by benefics cause Maala Yoga, while malefics in all Angles produce Sarpa Yoga. These two are Dala Yogas.

19. SANKHYA YOGAS. If all the seven planets occupy one Rāśi, Gola Yoga is formed. Similarly in 2 Rāśis-Yuga Yoga, In 3 Rāśis-Sula Yoga, in 4 Rāśis-Kedara Yoga, in 5 Rāśis-Pasa Yoga, in 6 Rāśis-Damini and in 7 Rāśis-Veena (Vallaki) Yoga.

20-21. EFFECTS OF NABHASA YOGAS. NAU YOGA. The native's livelihood will be through water; he will have many gains, will be very famous, be pleased, mean, strong and stingy. This and other Yogas are effective at all times independant of Dasas.

63. Whatever effects have been ascribed so far in this Ch. will specially reveal beneficially, if benefics aspect the 10th House from the Moon. If malefics aspect, the benefic results may not be there.

64. MALEFICS AND EFFECTS. Malefics in the 3rd, or in the 6th with reference to either the Ascendant, or the Moon will prove favourable, while in the 8th, 12th, or the Ascendant they are inauspiciousmore so in the Ascendant.

65. LIVELIHOOD. One's livelihood should be predicted based on the 10th from the Moon, or from the Ascendant; whichever is stronger will prevail. The earnings (livelihood) will also be indicated by the stronger of the Lords of the 10th counted from the Moon, or from the Ascendant.

66-80. SIGNS AND PROFESSIONS. If Aries, or many of its divisions be in the 10th, one will live through gardens, intelligence, service, agriculture, trading in juices (Rasa has other meanings, like liquor, poison, mercury, mineral/metallic salt etc.), or be an envoy.

81. PLANETS IN THE 10th AND THEIR EFFECTS. The Sun in the 10th indicates income through father, the Moon mother, Mars enemies, Mercury friends, Jupiter brothers, Venus females and Saturn servants.

82. There will be gains in many ways, if the Ascendant, the 2nd and the 11th are, respectively, occupied by strong (favourable) planets, so say the preceptors.

Thus ends the 33rd Ch. entitled “10th HOUSE AND EFFECTS THEREOF” in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Ch. 34. Different Houses and Worldly Affairs
1-7. EFFECTS OF SEVERAL PLANETS ASPECTING THE ASCENDANT. If the Sun aspects the Ascendant, the native will be valorous, will be irascible with females, be cruel, will gain wealth from paternal side and will serve the king.

If the Moon aspects the Ascendant, he will be under the control of women, fortunate, be very courteous, be very wealthy, softly disposed and will gain by dealing in water-born articles.

If Mars lends his aspect to the Ascendant, one will be fond of valorous acts and battles, irascible, will have severed relationship, be very righteous and will have a long penis.

Should Mercury aspect the Ascendant, the native will have rich knowledge of arts and will thereby gain and be quite intelligent, famous and honourable.

If Jupiter be the aspecting planet with reference to the Ascendant one will be interested in religious observations, be honoured by the king, be famous and will be endowed with (the company of) virtuous people, elders and guests.

Venus aspecting the Ascendant denotes, that he will be addicted to many prostitutes, be youthful, will have happiness of wealth and pleasure and will be beautiful in appearance.

If Saturn aspects the Ascendant one will be troubled by heavy loads, travels and diseases, be irascible, will be attached to aged women (i.e. will be fond of seeking union with aged females), be devoid of happiness, be dirty and foolish.

8. GENERAL ASPECTS TO ASCENDANT. If a planet (whether natural benefic, or natural malefic) aspects the Ascendant identical with its own Sign, that confers happiness and wealth, apart from close relationship with the king. If the Ascendant is not owned by the aspecting planet, a benefic then confers auspicious effects and a malefic evil results.

9. UNASPECTED ASCENDANT. Should the ascending Sign be not in aspect to even one planet, the native will be devoid of (other) qualities and will acquire exclusive qualities of the Sign concerned.

10-11. SPECIAL EFFECTS. If two, or more planets aspect the Ascendant, the native acquires happiness and wealth. Even one benefic aspecting the Ascendant is auspicious, while a malefic so aspecting is inauspicious. If the Ascendant is aspected by all the planets one rules over the earth. Should all the planets be endowed with strength, he will enjoy all kinds of happiness, be free from fear and be long-lived.

12. PLANETS CONJUNCT IN THE ASCENDANT. If three planets are together in the Ascendant, the native will be devoid of miseries and will lord over the earth. But, if these are (exclusively) malefics, he will be distressed due to fear, grief etc., will eat much and will be disregarded by one and all.

13. ADHI YOGA FROM ASCENDANT. If benefics exclusively occupy the 6th, 7th and 8th, without the company of malefics, Lagnadhi Yoga is caused. This Yoga confers ministership, leadership over Army (justiceship) and kingship, lordship over many women, long life, freedom from diseases and miseries, possession of virtues and happiness. So say Yavana kings.

14. A planet in own Sign, or in exaltation/friendly Sign, according to sages, confers its effects fully. If it is in fall, or is inimically placed, it is incapable of giving the results (due to the above mentioned Yoga).

15-20. PRINCIPLES RELATED TO THE 2ND HOUSE. If Mars, Saturn and the Sun occupy the 2nd House, the native's wealth is destroyed.

If weak Moon aspects the 2nd House, such effects are more pronounced.

Mars and the Sun in the 2nd cause afflictions to skin apart from causing poverty.

If Saturn, posited alone in this House, is aspected by Mercury, he will be greatly rich.

Even, if the Sun is posited in the 2nd House in aspect to Saturn, without aspect of others, pennilessness will come to pass.

Benefics in the 2nd House cause advent of money in many ways.

But, if Jupiter posited in the 2nd House remains under Mercury's aspect, or Mercury so posited in the 2nd House in aspect to the Moon, the entire wealth earned by the native will be deprived.

Weak Moon in the 2nd House in Mercury's aspect denotes, that even the ancestral property will be destroyed; not only this, other sources of income will also be hindered.

Should the 2nd House [from the] Moon be aspected by Venus, plenty of wealth will be earned. Same is the result by aspect of another benefic (i.e. Jupiter).

21-24. PRINCIPLES RELATED TO THE 3rd HOUSE. When the 3rd House is owned by a malefic and is occupied by a malefic, the co-born are destroyed. Conversely, a benefic's Sign being the 3rd and occupation of benefics therein will cause happiness thereof. Now explained below is the method to ascertain the number of co-born. The number of Navāńśas past in the 3rd House denotes the number of brothers following the native. If other planets aspect the 3rd House, the said number (caused by Navāńśas) stands increased. Saturn placed in the 3rd in aspect to Mars causes destruction of co-born. But Venus in the 3rd and in aspect to Jupiter increases happiness thereof. Mercury placed in the 3rd House, in aspect to Mars (or in aspect to the Sun, as some texts read ‘Bhaskara Drishtah' instead of ‘Angaraka Drishtah'), the native's friends are destroyed. Rest (relating to the 4th House) may be understood from Bhavadhyaya (Ch. 30).

25-26. ABOUT THE 5th HOUSE. If the 5th House contains a benefic, or is aspected by a benefic, or be a benefic's Rāśi, the native will surely beget children. If it is different, he will not obtain progeny. If the 5th House counted from the Moon, or the Ascendant, the stronger prevailing, has at least one Jupiter's division in the various Varga calculations, or has a benefic's Rāśi in it and is aspected by a benefic, the native will have legitimate issue.

27. NUMBER OF CHILDREN. If the Navāńśa of the 5th falls in a benefic's Rāśi the number of children equals the number of Navāńśas past in the 5th House. The aspect of a benefic on the 5th Bhava doubles the number, while malefic Rāśi, as 5th House Navāńśa and the said House receiving a malefic's aspect confers progeny with difficulty.

28. AUTHORIZING OTHER KINSMAN TO RAISE PROGENY FOR THE NATIVE. If the 5th House falls in the divisions (like Rāśi, Navāńśa, drekkana etc.) of Saturn and be with Mercury's aspect, but without that of Jupiter/Mars/Sun, the native obtains progeny by authorizing his kinsman to raise the same for him from his (the native's) wife. Similar result prevails, if Mercury's Rāśi be in the 5th House containing Mercury in it and is in aspect to Saturn, but without the aspect of the others, as cited above.

29. ADOPTED OR BOUGHT PROGENY. If the 5th House belongs to Saturn and be occupied by Saturn himself with the aspect of the Moon, one procures a child by adoption, or by an act of purchase. Identical effect follows the position of Mercury in the 5th House owned by him receiving the Moon's aspect.

30. ADOPTION SANS CONSENT. Should the 5th House contain Saturn unaspected by others and fall in a Sapthamsa owned by Mars, the native will adopt a grown up child without the consent of its natural parents.

31-32. BASE CHILDREN. If the 5th House contains the Sun and falls in the divisions of Saturn receiving the aspect of Mars, the children so obtained will be abject. Should the Moon be in the 5th House and receive exclusively Saturn's aspect, while the 5th House falls in a Navāńśa of Mars, even then the progeny will be foolish and base.

33. If the 5th House is occupied by Mars falling in many of Saturn's divisions and be in aspect to the Sun, one will obtain a son, that is adopted by a stranger after its being cast off by its original parents, so says sage Karuna.

34. ISSUE BY A REMARRIED WIDOW. Should the 5th House fall in Saturn's Vargas and contain both the Moon and Saturn therein, in aspect to both the Sun and Venus, progeny will be begotten by a widow given to the native in remarriage.

35. PROGENY BY A VIRGIN. Should the Moon be in the 7th along with the Sun, or the Moon being in the 5th in aspect to, or in the company of the Sun, one will obtain issue through an unmarried girl.

36. PROGENY BY A WOMAN PREGNANT AT MARRIAGE. If the 5th House falls in the divisions of the Luminaries and contains the Moon and the Sun in aspect to Venus only, one will have progeny by a woman, who will already be pregnant at the time of marriage.

37. ISSUELESSNESS. If the 5th House falls in a malefic's Sign and be occupied by strong malefics without benefic's aspect, the native will be childless.

38. PROGENY BY A FEMALE SLAVE. If the 5th House be in a Navāńśa of Venus and be aspected by Venus, one will beget progeny by a female servant. Some scholars opine, that even, if the Moon's Navāńśa and the Moon so come in the picture, the said effects will come to pass.

39. SONS AND DAUGHTERS. When the 5th House has exclusively the divisions of the Moon and Venus and be with aspects of Venus and the Moon alone, or be occupied by these two alone, or, when the said House has the divisions of only even Signs, the native will beget only female children. In a contrary situation, (i.e. 5th House falling in divisions of odd Signs only and be excluded from the occupation, or aspect of Venus and the Moon but others), there will be birth of only male children.

40. CHILDLESSNESS. When the Moon occupies the 10th House, Venus is in the 7th and malefics are in the 4th, the native's dynasty does not descend any further.

41. LOSS OF CHILDREN. Should Mars be in the 5th, the children of the native will pass away, as they are born. However, if Jupiter, or Venus lend aspect to the said position, the loss relates only to the first child. If all planets aspect (the said Mars), then there is no loss at all of children.

42. SPECIAL EFFECTS. Should the 5th House be occupied exclusively by malefics, the native will be devoid of wealth, own men and happiness. If Mars is in the 5th House, he will be distressed (or deformed). Saturn so posited denotes sickness. The occupations of Mercury, Jupiter, or Venus will confer abundant happiness and wealth.

43-44. ENEMIES. If the 6th House is aspected by Saturn and occupied by Mars, the native will have fear from enemies. Occupation, or aspect of benefics will keep one free from such fear. The number of enemies (causing trouble) will correspond to the number of planets posited in the 6th House. Rest of the related matters may be understood from the previous pages, (Ch. 30).

45 ABOUT THE 7th HOUSE. If Jupiter, Moon, Venus and Mercury be in the 7th, in any manner (i.e. one of them, two, three, or all of them in the 7th), or other divisions falling in the 7th House, or, if the 7th House be in aspect to these, one will procure a wife corresponding to the planet/s and Rāśi/s in question.

46. Should the 7th House contain malefics, or fall in malefic planets' divisions, the wife of the native will be destroyed (i.e. adversely affected). These results can be deduced from the Ascendant and the Moon, the stronger of them having more significance. If the Moon be in the 7th (from the Ascendant) along with Saturn, the native will marry a widow.

47. The number of wives will correspond to the number of heavenly bodies aspecting the 7th, or the Navāńśas past in the 7th House. There will be a single wife, if Leo, Aries, or Scorpio rise in Navāńśa, or, if Mercury and Jupiter join together in the 7th House.

48. If the 7th House has many divisions of Venus and the Moon, or is occupied by these two, there will be plurality of wives. Specially Venus in the 7th will cause such an effect.

49. Jupiter and Venus related to the 7th House will confer a bride of the same caste, while the Sun, Mars, Saturn and the Moon denote a female belonging to a mean order. As per Ketumalacharya, Venus and Moon related to the 7th House will cause relationship with whores.

50-51. Mars in the 7th House will make one go devoid of wife. If he is, while so posited in aspect to only Saturn, the wife will certainly pass away.

Should Mars and Venus be together in the 7th, or 5th, or 9th, the native will beget a languid, or deformed wife.

52. It is the unanimous opinion of all the sages, that, if the Moon and the Sun are, respectively, in the 12th and the 6th, both the native and his wife will be one-eyed.

53. If Saturn occupies the Ascendant, while Venus is in the 7th identical with Ganda Rāśi and the 5th is bereft to beneficial aspect, the person acquires a barren wife.

54-55. One will be devoid of a wife and an issue, if malefics occupy the Ascendant, 12th and 7th, while decreasing Moon is in the 5th. Both the native and his wife will be immoral, if the 7th House falls in the various divisions of Saturn and Mars, while Venus is posited in the 7th in aspect to Mars and Saturn.

56. When the 7th House is occupied by Mercury and Venus, the native will be bereft of both wife and progeny. If however this combination receives the aspect of a benefic, there will be obtainment of a wife at an advanced age.

57. Should the Moon, along with even one of Mercury, Jupiter and Venus, be in the 7th, the native will be opulent.

58. ABOUT THE 11TH HOUSE. The native will gain through kings, wars, thieves, forests, quadrupeds etc., if the Sun is placed in the 11th House, or, if the 11th House is aspected, or owned by the Sun.

59. Should the Moon be in the 11th House, or her division so related to the 11th House the native will gain through females and through sales of elephants. If the Moon is declining, these are not much, but an increasing Moon increases these gains greatly.

60. Mars, or his divisions related to the 11th House, as above denotes gains through gold, coral, ornaments, ruby, money, valour, coming and going (i.e. travels), fire and weapons.

61. Should Mercury, or his divisions be related to the 11th, as above, the native will gain by writing, arts, literature and arguments.

62. Jupiter, or his divisions so related to the 11th House indicates gains through headship of a city, royal mercy, Sacrifices (religious), meritorious acts, gold and horses.

63. When the planet Venus, or his divisions are so connected with the 11th House, one will gain through connections with prostitutes, travels, pearls and silver.

64. Saturn, or his divisions so connected with the 11th House indicates gains through towns and villages, acts of lasting nature, iron, donkeys and buffaloes.

65. The effects attributed above stand increased, if benefics aspect the 11th House, will decrease by malefic influence and will remain mixed with the interference of both benefics and malefics.

66. If the 11th House is aspected by (or associated with) all the planets, advent of wealth will be in several ways. The strongest of those will have the highest influence.

67. A planet in it's own Sign, or in a friendly Sign will give half of the effects attributed. These effects are full, if it is in its exaltation Sign, very meager, if it is combust and just one fourth, if inimically placed.

68. The effects relating to the 11th House, as mentioned above will be experienced right from birth, according to Yavanas. But according Lokaksha (a preceptor by that name), kings and heads of zones stand to enjoy abundant gains (as against a common man).

69-70. ABOUT THE 12th HOUSE. If the Sun, or weak Moon is placed in the 12th, the native's wealth will be lost to the king. Mars posited in the 12th in aspect to Mercury, will cause losses in several ways Jupiter, the Moon (with increasing rays) and Venus in the 12th will cause growth of wealth, provided there is no aspect from Mars on them. Rest may be understood from the previous portion (Ch. 30).

71. MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS. Even a person born in regal scion will become an artisan, if the Ascendant in Mercury's decanate receives the aspect of the Moon from an Angle.

72. Should Venus be in the 12th House in Virgo identical with Saturn's Navāńśa, while the Luminaries are in the 7th in aspect to Saturn, the native's mother though belonging to a noble race will become a slave.

73. Should Saturn occupy the 2nd House counted from the Sun, while the Moon and Mars, respectively, are in the 10th cusp and 7th House with reference to the Ascendant, the native will always be distressed.

74. The native will suffer from pulmonary and spleenary disorders apart from tuberculosis, if the Moon is hemmed between malefics, as Saturn occupies the 7th House.

75. Should there be an exchange between the Sun and the Moon in the Navāńśa, the native will suffer from phlegmatic disorders. Should the Sun and the Moon be in one Rāśi having identical longitudes, the native will be emaciated at all times.

76. Should the 8th, 2nd, 6th and the 12th be, respectively, occupied by the Sun, Moon, Mars and Saturn, the native will lose his eyes due to the affliction caused by the strongest of the tour.

77. If malefics occupy the 6th, 11th, 3rd and 5th, the native will suffer from ear defects, provided there are no aspects from benefic planets. Malefics in the 7th unaspected by benefics will produce dental afflictions.

78. There will be diseases of the mind, if Saturn occupies the Ascendant, while Mars is in the 5th, or the 9th. Alternatively, Saturn, while being in the Ascendant should be conjunct decreasing Moon to cause the said effects.

Thus ends the 34th Ch. entitled “DIFFERENT HOUSES AND WORLDLY AFFAIRS” in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Ch. 35. Raja Yogas
1. This science is mainly useful to rulers. Hence I explain in this Ch. the configurations, that make one a king.

2. KINGLY/WEALTHY YOGAS. One born in a royal scion will become a ruler, if 3, or 4 planets, with strength, occupy their exaltation/Mulatrikona Signs at birth. If 5, or 6 planets be so placed, even a person of mean birth will attain rulership. If one, or two heavenly bodies be so, the native will only be rich, being equal to a king, but not really be a king.

3. According to Yavanas, if only malefics are exalted, the native will become a king indulging, in cruel deeds. But, as per Jeevasarma, such planets will make one valorous, but not a king. One with such a Yoga (according to Kalyanavarma) will be honoured and will become the head of a region.

4. Explained below are the Yogas, that will make even a person of base birth a king, according to Shastras.

5. If all the four of the Sun, Mars, Saturn and Jupiter, or three of them, be exalted and one of them be simultaneously in the Ascendant, a total of 16 kinds of Raja Yogas are formed. One born even in a mean caste with such a Yoga will become a ruler. Again a different group of 16 Raja Yogas are formed, if one, or two out of the above four planets are in exaltation, while one of the exalted planets occupies the Ascendant, as the Moon remains in Cancer. According to great sages, these 32 Yogas will make one a ruler, who reigns the whole earth, as though it is just a garden.

6. If at the time of birth either the Ascendant, or the Moon be in Vargothama Navāńśa and be in aspect to 5, or 6 planets other than the Moon (when the Ascendant being considered) one will become a king in spite of his having taken birth in a mean family.

7. If at birth Aries be the Ascendant containing the Moon, Mars and Jupiter one will become an emperor of the whole earth encircled by the seas and the Udayagiri (i.e. the mountain, from which the Sun etc. are supposed to rise) and will roaringly destroy his enemies.

8. Should Jupiter be in Cancer, while Mars occupies Aries identical with the Ascendant, or should both Jupiter and Mars be in Aries Ascendant, the native will become a ruler whose enemies dare not approach him, while his minister will be favourable to him.

9. Should the Moon be in the 11th House along with Venus and Jupiter, while Aries, Capricorn and Virgo are occupied by their Lords, one born in Virgo Ascendant will doubtlessly become a very knowledgeable king.

10. If Cancer Ascendant contain the Moon with full bright rays, while the 7th, 6th, 4th, 10th and 3rd are, respectively, occupied by Mercury, Sun, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn, the native will become a ruler. Simultaneously Mars should be conjunct Saturn.

11. Should Taurus ascend at birth with the Full Moon, as Aquarius, Leo and Scorpio are tenanted, respectively, by Saturn, the Sun and Jupiter, the native will become a king with abundant riches and with conveyances.

12. If Capricorn Ascendant birth along with Saturn, while Pisces, Gemini, Virgo and Sagittarius are, respectively, occupied by the Moon, Mars, Mercury and Jupiter, one will become a ruler equal to Indra, Lord of the Lords.

13. If the Moon is in Pisces identical with Ascendant, while Capricorn, Aquarius and Leo are in their order occupied by Mars, Saturn and the Sun, one will become a ruler well versed in all arts.

14. One will become an unconquerable king, with knowledge of the Vedas, if he takes birth in Capricorn Ascendant with exalted Mars, if it opposed by Full Moon in Cancer.

Thus ends the 35th Ch. entitled “RAJA YOGAS” in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Ch. 36. Planetary Rays
1. The rays possessed by a planet are important (in delineation of a horoscope) according to Manindhacharya. I explain below the same.

2. When in exaltation, the number of rays possessed by the Sun are 10, the Moon 9, Mars 5, Mercury 5, Jupiter 7, Venus 8 and Saturn 5.

3-4. ANOTHER SCHOOL OF THOUGHT. The above view is held by Manindha, Maya and Badarayana, as enunciated by Mahendra Shastra. However, according to another school of thought, all planets uniformly possess 7 rays each, while exaltation. While these two are authoritative schools, majority lean towards equal distribution of 7 rays. All agree, that at debilitation, the figure is zero for each planet.

5. ABHIMUKHA AND PARANMUKHA RASMI. When a debilitated planet transits towards its exaltation Sign, the rays are Abhimukha (i.e. facing upwards) and, when an exalted planet goes towards its debilitation Sign, the rays are Paranmukha (facing downwards). For the intermediary positions, the rays should be calculated by rule of three process.

6. TO ARRIVE AT NUMBER OF RAYS. Note the position of the planet in Rāśis, degrees etc., for which the number of rays is to be computed. Deduct from this its (deep) debilitation point. If the remainder is in excess of six Signs, reduce it again from 12. Multiply the product by the maximum number of rays allotted to the planet concerned and divide by six. The resultant figure will represent the number of rays obtained by the planet by virtue of its position at birth.

7-9. RECTIFICATION OF RAYS. If the planet is in the dwadasamsa of its friend, double the product, as obtained above. If it is in its own dwadasamsa, own Rāśi, retrogression/exaltation Sign the product should be trebled. If it is in its enemy's dwadasamsa, 1/16th of the rays will be lost. The same applies to a debilitated planet. A combust planet, excepting Venus and Saturn, loses all the rays. A planet, that has just begun to retrograde will have two-fold rays, while the one, that has just assumed direct motion from retrogression will lose only 1/8th of the number of rays.

10-11. EFFECTS OF NUMBER OF RASMIS TOTALLY CONTRIBUTED BY THE SEVEN PLANETS. If the rays be a maximum of five, the native will be miserable, is of ignoble descent, will depend on others, be indigent and will join base men, Should it be from 6 to 10, he will be a servant, will be intent on going to places other than of his birth (for living), be devoid of good luck and be dirty.

12-16. If the rays are between 11 and 15, one will be, respectively, very learned, virtuous, righteous, beautiful and will possess merits due to his descent. If the rays are between 16 and 20, he will be, respectively, supreme among his men, be wealthy, be famous among men, be glorious and be honoured by his men. The effects stated apply to the number of rays in the ascending order. If the rays are from 21 to 25 in number, the effects, respectively, are: honour, fortune, courage, scholarship and kingship. 26 rays denote a person, who will have all-round success in his efforts. 27 to 32 rays, respectively, denote: a dependent on the king, wealth and gains through the king, minister ship, honours from the king, royal patronage and rulership over fifty villages.

17-20. If the total number of rays is 33, he will rule over 1000 villages, while with 34 rays he will obtain leadership over 3000 villages. 35 rays denote abundant wealth, strength, provincial rulership, fame, fortune etc. One will head over a lakh villages with 36 rays. Three lakh villages will come under his control with 37/38 rays.

21-25. If the total rays be 39, he will become a ruler causing happiness to all. With 40 rays he will rule over vast lands and the wives of the enemies crushed by him will reach their cries all over, so that he will become prominent. One, two and three seas will be the boundary/boundaries of the kingdom of the native/s with 41/42/43 rays. One with 44 rays will be an emperor, will honour Gods and Brahmins, be long-lived and be mighty. According to the rays crossing 44, one will rule over other islands, be free from obstacles, be honoured by one and all and be equal to Indra in valour.

26. SPECIAL EFFECTS. If the total rays are 45, or 46, the native will always enjoy auspicious effects and will lord over the entire earth.

27. If the rays are 47, the native will undertake the responsibility of maintaining the whole earth, be devoid of enemies, be an emperor akin to Indra and be honoured by all.

28-29. ABHIMUKHA AND PARANMUKHA. If a planet has Abhimukha rays the good effects stated will increase, while Paranmukha rays will reduce the good effects. More number of rays will multiply the results, while less number of rays will diminish the effects. According to rays only, one's baseness, or excellence will come to pass.

Thus ends the 36th Ch. entitled “PLANETARY RAYS” in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Ch. 37. Panchamahapurusha Yogas
1. Sri Devakirti Raja explained the Panchamahapurusha Yogas (denoting Great Men), which 1 explain below clearly.

Thus ends the 38th Ch. entitled “GUNA TATWA PHALA” in Kalyana Varma's “SARAVALI”.

Ch. 39. Obstructions To RajaYogas
1. Earlier, the Yogas of kinghood have been explained. There can be some factors, which prevent the effects of such Yogas, which I explain in this Ch..

2. Out of Mars, Saturn, Jupiter and the Sun, if two, or more be in fall and one of them simultaneously be in the Ascendant, as the Moon is in Scorpio, the RajaYogas will become futile.

3. The RajaYogas in the horoscope are only name sake, if the Moon being weak is in the last Navāńśa of a Movable Sign, or in the 8th Navāńśa of a Fixed Sign, or in the first Navāńśa of a Common Sign and is without aspect from any other planet.

4. Same effects will come to pass, if all malefics occupy Angles identical with debilitation/inimical Signs, while benefics are shunted to the 12th, 6th and 8th Houses.

5. If the Ascendant is in Vargothama position without aspect to any planet, the RajaYogas will only be a failure.

6. Even a hundred kingly Yogas will be of no avail, if Aquarius rises, while 3 heavenly bodies are in their Signs of fall.

7. If there is no benefic in an Angle, or with the Moon, while 4 planets are either in fall, or in combustion, or in inimical Signs, the RajaYogas are marred.

8. Should the Sun be in his own Navāńśa, while the Moon is in combustion and in aspect to malefics without the aspect of benefics, the native will enjoy rulership (with the help of other Raja Yogas) only to relinquish the kingdom soon and will become miserable.

9. Should the Moon lend her inimical aspect to the Ascendant Lord, while the Sun, Mars and Saturn are in their order in the 3rd, 6th and 7th, the RajaYogas will become ineffective. Benefics should in this case be not in Angles, but suffer combustion.

10. If five heavenly bodies are in fall at birth the RajaYogas will not come to pass.

11. If meteor, noise of contending winds in the sky (or earth quake, or thunder), Vyatipata, or Upaketu be seen at the time of birth, the good RajaYogas stand nullified.

12. If Trisankhu Nakshatra (Trisankhu was a monarch of the solar race, who remained suspended with his head towards the earth, as a constellation in the southern hemisphere) rises at the time of one's birth, while the Ascendant is occupied by Saturn, as there is fall of a comet, the Raja Yogas do not come to pass.

13. If the planets capable of causing Raja Yoga are inclined to enter in war, or are becoming splendourless, or about to lose their strength, the RajaYogas will stand canceled.

14. If weak Moon is in her deep degree of debilitation the RajaYogas get destroyed, just as a king going against an astrologer.

15. The Sun in the 10th degree of Libra will destroy all RajaYogas, just as miserliness eclipses all the good attributes of a person.

16. This Sloka is repeated in the original. The meaning is identical with that of Sloka 15 above.

17. Even though other planets may be in their Mulatrikona, exaltation, or own Signs, while the Sun is singly in deep fall, the RajaYogas will be unavailable.

18. If Jupiter occupies Capricorn, as Ascendant, while the Moon is not in Cancer, the native will become miserable, just as a penniless lewdster in the place of a courtesan.

19. If in the formation of Kemadruma Yoga, the Moon is without the aspect of another planet, the RajaYogas lose their existence and the native will be devoid of good conduct.

20. If 3, or more planets be in fall even the son of an emperor ruling over the entire earth will take to begging, be miserable, be dirty and penniless.

21. If 5 planets occupy inimical Signs, or are in combustion, while the Sun, or the Moon is not in exaltation, the kingly Yogas will become ineffective.

22. If Venus occupy his debilitation Navāńśa, even a vast kingdom is deprived from the native.

23. RajaYogas have been explained earlier. The combinations marring such kingly states are given in this Ch.. The stronger one of these two will only prevail.

24. RAJA YOGA. The Sun in Virgo, Mars in Scorpio along with Jupiter, as the Moon is in Aries: this configuration will produce a king the dust of whose elephants will darken the-skies.

Thus ends the 39th Ch. entitled “OBSTRUCTIONS TO RAJAYOGAS” In Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Ch. 40. Calculation of Longevity
1. The people all over remain perplexed over the question of longevity. So I narrate the relative principles based on the Shastras here under.

2-3. SELECTION OF SYSTEM FOR LONGEVITY COMPUTATION. Out of the triothe Sun, the Moon and the Ascendant, if the Ascendant is the strongest, Amsayurdaya should be resorted to. Pindayu is the best, if the Sun is predominant, while Nisargayu is the apt choice with Moon prevailing. If the three in question are bereft of strength, then Jeevasarma's system can be used.

4. AMSAYURDAYA CALCULATIONS. The longitudes (counted from Aries first point) of the (seven) planets and the Ascendant should be divided by 200 to get the number of years. The quotients in later processes should be multiplied by the respective multipliers to get months, days and Ghatis.

5. ADDITIONS FOR ASCENDANT'S CONTRIBUTION. If the Ascendant is strong the number of years equal to the Rāśis it has traversed should be added. Months etc. thereof should be guessed by rule of three method.

6. RECTIFICATIONS FOR PLANETARY CONTRIBUTIONS. The contribution made by a planet, that is in Vargothama, own Sign, own decanate, or own Navāńśa should be doubled. If it is retrograde, or in exaltation the figure should be trebled.

7. If a planet's contribution gets doubled by virtue of position in own Sign, own decanate etc. (as per Sloka 6 above) and further warrants trebling by virtue of retrogression/exaltation, the trebling should also be done. So say the learned.

8. According to Chudamani Acharya, if a planet is in Angle contributions by each rectification shall be considered. If it is in Panaphara (2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th) only two multiplications be done. If it is in Apoklima (3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th) only one (i.e. the highest) should be taken.

9. According to Varaha Mihira, if many multiplications are warranted, only the highest be considered. But this view is not acceptable to ancestors.

10. REDUCTIONS FOR AMSAYURDAYA CONTRIBUTIONS. If a planet is in its inimical Sign, a third of the earlier (final) figure should only be taken. If it is combust in the Sun, only half need be computed. The contributions by Venus and Saturn do not suffer reductions on account of their combustion.

11-12. VYAYADI (CHAKRARDHA) HARANA. A malefic in the 12th loses all his contribution. If in the 11th half, in the 10th a third, in the 9th a fourth, in the 8th one fifth and in the 7th one sixth of the contribution suffers. Benefics in these places lose just half of what malefics lose. Further, if there are two, or more planets in one and the same House, only the strongest suffers reduction.

13-15. PINDAYU. In this system the planets from the Sun onwards through Saturn contribute, respectively, 19, 25, 15, 12, 15, 21 and 20 in their order, when they are in (deep) exaltation. From the longitude of the planet (for which the contribution is being computed) deduct its highest exaltation degree (counted from Aries first point). In case the minuend is greater than the subtrahend, then increase the former by 12 Signs i.e. 360 degrees). Multiply the latest product by the number of years allotted for the planet and divide by 12 to get years. Dividers for months equal to Amsas (or degrees i e. 30) and for days Vikalas (i.e. 60).

16. In the case of Pindayurdaya also the same multiplications and rectifications apply. Leaving aside a retrograde planet, one in inimical Sign loses a third, while the one in fall retains only half of the contribution. The planet in exaltation retains the entire contribution.

17. ASCENDANTAL CONTRIBUTION IN PINDAYURDAYA. If the Navāńśa Lagna Lord is strong, then the years contributed will equal the Navāńśas past, If, however, the Lagna Rāśi Lord is stronger, then the Rāśis past up to Lagna (counted from Aries) will be the number of years.

18-19. REDUCTION FOR RISING PLANETS. If malefics occupy the Ascendant, convert the Ascendant into degrees, minutes etc. Multiply this by the number of years contributed by the malefics in question. Then divide the product by 21,600. Respective products should be reduced from the earlier contributions of each of the malefics occupying the Ascendant. (This will be the net contribution by each malefic in case he occupies the Ascendant). If the malefics in Ascendant are aspected by the benefics suffice it to say half of the reduction need only be done.

20. NISARGA YURDAYA. In the Nisargayu scheme, the planets from the Sun to Saturn contribute 20, 1, 2, 9, 18, 20 and 50, respectively.

21. FULL SPAN OF LIFE. The full span of life (120 years and 5 days) will be enjoyed by the native, who has Pisces Ascendant with its 9th Navāńśa and Mercury in 25 degrees of Taurus, while others are in their deep exaltation points.

22. UNLIMITED LONGEVITY. Jupiter along with the Moon in Cancer identical with the Ascendant, Mercury with Venus in an Angle (or separately in Angles), while the rest are in the 3rd, 6th and 11th: One with this combination will enjoy a limitless life span.

23-24. SPAN OF FULL LIFE FOR VARIOUS ANIMALS. The full span of life of elephants and men are 120 years and 5 days. For horses it is 32 years, for goats etc. 16 years, for camels and donkeys 25 years, for cows and buffaloes 24 years and for dogs 12 years. Just as for the mankind, the longevity for the various animals can be computed. The computations should be done, as explained supra, multiplied by the figure representing full life span and divided by 120.

25. Only those, who consume wholesome diet, those, who are virtuous, those, who have good conduct and those, who conquer their senses will enjoy the longevity, as laid down by the sages.

Thus ends the 40th Ch. entitled “LONGEVITY CALCULATION” in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Ch. 41. Moola Dasa
1. The Dasa duration of a planet is equal to the number of years it contributes (as per Moola Dasa scheme). All planets yield in their Dasas pleasant, or unpleasant results according to their (natal) dispositions.

2. ORDER OF THE SCHEME. According to Manitha, those, who are born during day time will have the Dasas commencing with that of the Sun, while the night-born will have it from that of Venus. But this view is not acceptable to other preceptors.

3. SATYA'S VIEW. The first Dasa will be of the strongest of the Ascendant, the Sun and the Moon followed by the ones in Angle, Panaphara and Apoklima. This is the view held by Satyacharya.

4-5. The first Dasa will be of the strongest of the Ascendant, the Sun and the Moon. Then the planets in Angles will be Dasa Lords. Thereafter the planets in Panapharas (2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th Houses) will lord over the major periods, while the last Dasas will be headed by the planets posited in Apoklimas (3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th Houses). If Angles etc. are occupied by more than one planet, the strongest will have its Dasa first. Even, if the strengths of these be identical, then the order will be according to maximum years donated by these planets Granting, that these durations are also similar, then the risings of planets will prevail, Even, if one of the triad, viz. the Ascendant, the Sun and the Moon, is strong, then Satya's scheme, as above should be resorted to. If none is strong enough, then the Dasa scheme of other preceptors may be considered.

6. AUSPICIOUS PERIODS. Planets in exaltation, own Rāśi, own Navāńśa, friendly Sign, possessing full rays and those with full strength prove auspicious in their Dasas. At the commencement of a Dasa a planet, that is strong, or is in a friendly division, or is in aspect to a benefic will also yield similar good results.

7. INAUSPICIOUS PERIODS. The planet, that is in its Sign of fall, Sign ruled by an enemy, Navāńśa of an enemy, combust in the Sun, devoid of splendour, or is in aspect to malefics will yield inauspicious effects in its Dasa.

8. If a planet has departed from its exaltation, its Dasa is known, as Avarohini (stepping down) Dasa. If, however, it is in own, or friendly divisions, the effects will be medium, i.e. neither good nor bad. The Dasa of a planet approaching its exaltation, departing from debilitation, is known, as Arohini (climbing) Dasa. If the said planet is in inimical, or debilitation divisions, it will inflict difficulties.

9. The Sun is the ripener (or baker) of the effects of a Dasa, while the Moon is the sustaining agent. That is why the Moon's transit position at the time of the commencement of a Dasa should be duly considered.

10-14. EFFECTS OF THE MOON. If the Moon at the commencement of a Moola Dasa is in Virgo, the native throughout the period will be related to courtesans and be associated with them. This view is held by Yavanas. If she is in Cancer at the beginning of Dasa, the native will gain wealth through virtuous ladies. If in Aries, or in Scorpio he will injure the honour of virgins and also bring evils to his own female. If the Sign in question be of Mercury knowledge of Shastras and acquisition of friends will come to pass. In a Sign of Venus, it brings plenty of food and drinks, happiness and destruction of enemies. In a House of Jupiter, it brings happiness, wealth, honour and commandability. Saturn's Sign endows with association with old ladies. Leo denotes movements in forts and forests, agriculture and misunderstanding with wife and children. These are the effects accruing out of the Moon's placement at the commencement of a Dasa.

15. ASPECTS TO MOON AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF A DASA. If the Moon at the commencement of a Dasa receives the aspect of Mars, or Saturn there will be loss of relatives and of wealth followed by diseases. Mercury's aspect confers learning, while the aspects of other planets will give effects according to their nature.

16. MAJOR LORD'S PLACEMENT AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF A DASA. If the Lord of the Dasa is in the Ascendant prevailing at the moment the Dasa begins, or in the 3rd, 6th, 10th, or 11th from the said Ascendant, the Dasa then proves excellent.

17-18. AGAIN MOON'S PLACEMENT. If the Moon at the commencement of a major period occupy a friendly Sign, exaltation Sign, or an Upachaya House (3rd, 6th, 10th, or 11th House), 5th, 9th, or 7th counted from the major Lord, good effects will come to pass in the Dasa in question. If the Moon is otherwise placed, even a planet in exaltation at birth will give inauspicious results in its Dasa.

19. SPECIAL EFFECTS BASED ON NAVĀŃŚA. Even though a planet may be in friendly Sign, if it occupies simultaneously a Navāńśa belonging to its enemy, or be in fall in Navāńśa, the effects in the Dasa concerned will be mixed. A weak planet's Dasa will be futile.

20. LAGNA DASA. The Ascendant's major period will prove auspicious, if it is in the first decanate of a Movable Sign; medium in the second decanate and poor in the 3rd decanate. The reverse is true with a Common Sign ascending, i e. third, second and first decanate will, respectively, be auspicious, medium and poor. As for a Fixed Sign ascending first, second and third decanates will, respectively, give poor, auspicious and medium effects.

21. NAISARGIKA DASA. The Naisargika Dasa follows in the order of the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, the Sun, Saturn and the Ascendant.

22-24. If the planet is exalted, or is endowed with temporal strength, or full strength, in its Dasa incomparably auspicious results will come to pass. The planet, that is in its own Sign, Moolatrikona Sign, own Navāńśa, or hemmed between benefics will yield moderately auspicious effects. The planet, that is going towards its exaltation (departing from Sign of its fall), or is placed in friendly Signs etc., feebly auspicious effects will be felt. Similar deductions should be made in regard to planets otherwise placed.

25-26. EFFECTS OF FAVOURABLE SUN'S DASA. If the Sun is favourable, in his Dasa, there will be gains from forests, medicines, travels, poison, evil friendship, forests, ivory, skin, fire and royal association. Courage, diligence, intelligence, fame and valour will be on the increase. Excellence and kingship will be achieved by the native.

27-28. EFFECTS OF ADVERSE SUN'S DASA. If the Sun is adverse, in his Dasa there will be grief on account of servants, wealth, theft, eyes, weapons, fire, water and king and the native will be tormented by children, wife and relatives He will be interested in sinful acts and be troubled by hunger, thirst (or morbid fever), heart ailments, bilious diseases and bodily damages.

29-30½. EFFECTS OF FAVOURABLE MOON'S DASA.

31-32. EFFECTS OF ADVERSE MOON'S DASA. If the Moon is evil, in her Dasa there will be fear in family, misunderstanding with one's family members, difficulties, loss of wealth, enmity with royal assembly, sleep, indolence, evils through women and grief.

33-34. EFFECTS OF FAVOURABLE MARS DASA. During the Dasa of favourable Mars, one will gain through kings, fire, thieves, enemies, snakes, poison, weapons, confinements, fictitious articles, lands, goats, buffaloes, copper, gold, prostitutes, gambling, intoxicants, pungent articles/juices, wealth and grains.

35-36 EFFECTS OF ADVERSE MARS DASA. During the Dasa of evil Mars, there will be enmity with friends, wife, children and brothers, sufferances from thirst, swooning, bloody defects, loss of limbs and wounds. There will be attachment to others' wives and irreligious acts, followed by aversion to elders and to truth. Bilious excesses will trouble the subject.

37-39. EFFECTS OF FAVOURABLE MERCURY DASA. In the Dasa of favourable Mercury, there will be gains via friends, children, wealth, king, businessmen, priests, gambling etc. The native will acquire horses, lands, gold, fame, ambassadorship, limitless happiness, fortunes, high intelligence, fame, success in religious activities, fond of amusement, destruction of foes and enthusiasm in mathematics and drawings.

40. EFFECTS OF ADVERSE MERCURY S DASA. If Mercury is evil, in the concerned Dasa the native will be tormented by imbalances of the three temperaments (viz. bile, phlegm and wind), hard disposition, imprisonment, mental grief and excitement.

41-43. EFFECTS OF FAVOURABLE JUPITER'S DASA. If Jupiter is favourable, the native in that Dasa will gain through ministers (or advisers), kings, dances and states manship. He will gain honours, virtues, courage, wide friend ship, life partner, gold, quadrupeds, conveyances, auspicious acts, destruction of enemies, royal acquiantance and will obtain wealth through public, king, businessmen and elders.

44. EFFECTS OF ADVERSE JUPITER'S DASA. If Jupiter be inauspicious one will in such Dasa have physical defects, excessive grief, lameness, diseases of the stomach and ears, loss of semen and marrow and fear from kings.

45-46. EFFECTS OF FAVOURABLE VENUS DASA. If Venus is auspicious one will in the Dasa be successful and will gain lands, residences, bed comforts, wife, garlands, robes, good food, fame, happiness and treasure. He will have liking for music, will develop acqaintance with females, will gain through kings and lands, will derive wisdom, desired happiness and friends and gains through articles used for sexual enjoyments.

47. EFFECTS OF UNFAVORABLE VENUS DASA. If Venus is inauspicious the native will in the Dasa have litigations with virtuous people, will have troubles from conveyances, furniture, females and kings and will develop intimacy with unsocial elements.

48-49. EFFECTS OF FAVOURABLE SATURN'S DASA. If Saturn is favourable in his Dasa the native will gain camels, asses etc., association with unchaste, or old ladies, gain through pulses, sesamum and grains eaten by poor people, leadership over villages and iron etc. His people will acquire a permanent position.

If Saturn is adverse, there will be loss of conveyances, excitement, enmity, separation from wife and other family members, loss in battles, liking for intoxicants and gambling, windy diseases, loss of meritorious acts, confinement, lassitude, affliction to limbs and enmity with children and servants.

52. The good and bad effects for the Dasas have been explained above in a general manner. Narrated below are the effects arising out of special considerations.

53. SUN'S DASA. There are five kinds of placements, which enable us to derive five different types of Sun's Dasa. These positions are: exaltation, fall, Moolatrikona, Angle and enemy's Sign.

54-59. The Sun in Ascendant gives kingdom during his Dasa; while posited in other Kendras ruled by inimical planets there will be disorders of hip, throat and eyes. Debilitated Sun in his Dasa causes destruction of eyes, fever and head disorders, confinement, leprosy and other disorders. If the Sun is exalted, there will be gain of kingdom with royal insignia in such Dasa. Apart, there will be acquisition of elephants, steeds etc. The Dasa of the Sun placed in his Moolatrikona will indicate destruction of all kinds of miseries and leadership of large provinces. In the Dasa of the Sun placed in inimical Sign, one will incur affliction of eyes, hump-back, disorders caused by fire, facial diseases and humiliation due to misconduct. The 8th House placement of the Sun will cause in his Dasa affliction to the entire body and wanderings in various countries.

60-65. MOON'S DASA. The Moon's Dasa is generally differentiated in six categories, viz. exalted, debilitated, friendly Sign, inimical Sign and diminishing and increasing Moon's Dasas. The different dignities of the Moon give following results in the Dasa concerned: exaltedkingdom, debilitated death, inimical Sign confinement, friendly Sign association with own men, decreasing Moon fever and disorders of abdomen, head and eyes. If the Moon is full and is endowed with strength, in such Dasa the native will be surrounded by thousands of superior females. If she be relegated to the 8th House, the native in such Dasa will be humiliated by his own men, will live through machinery, grass, firewood, cowdung, bamboo, medicinal plants, fruits and water. He will acquire only deteriorated food and rags and even a king will have to resort to servitude.

66-68. OTHER PLACEMENT OF PLANETS. Those exalted in the Ascendant confer rulership of a province in their Dasas, while those in exaltation in other Angles will bestow, wealth, conveyances and rulership of a country. If a planet is in the 6th, the native will be subjected to evils, misfortunes etc. In the Dasa of a planet placed in the 8th, death will be inflicted. There will only be confinement in the Dasa of a combust planet. The Dasa of a retrograde planet will cause wanderings, like that of a wheel, evils and enmity. This applies only to malefics in retrogression, but not to benefics.

69. Though one may be a king, he will become a servant of his own servants in the Dasas of a planet devoid of strength, a planet totally devoid of strength, a planet in fall, a planet in deep fall, a planet in inimical Sign and a planet in dead enemy's.

70. In the Dasa of a planet placed in enemy's Sign, there will be circumstances to leave one's own country (in distress), diseases, loss of position, frequent quarrels and confinement.

71. Even a king with vast number of elephants, that can wet the earth with their ichor, will surely wander in difficulty in the Dasa of a planet occupying an inimical Sign.

72-73. In the Dasas of the planets placed in the 6th, 5th, 9th, or 7th Houses identical with inimical Signs, there will be troubles to limbs and secondary limbs (like the nose), while the Dasa of the planet in the 8th House identical with its inimical House will cause beheading (or afflictions to head), fear from enemies, wanderings in foreign places, troubles of confinement, diseases etc. If the Dasa of a planet, that is in fall be in operation humiliation from royal sources will follow.

74. The Native will derive (good) effects of a weak planet's Dasa in dreams and thoughts. The effects due to Pancha Maha Purusha Yogas will come to pass in the Dasas of the concerned planets.

75. The planets in Seershodaya Signs will give their effects in the beginning of the Dasas; those in Ubhayodaya will give in the middle of the Dasas effects due to them and those in Prishtodaya Signs as well, as those in fall will reveal their effects in the concluding parts of their Dasas.

Thus ends the 41st Ch. entitled “MOOLA DASA” in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Ch. 42. Effects Of Sub Periods
1. DISTRIBUTION OF SUB PERIODS TO PLANETS IN MOOLA DASA. A planet, that is conjunct the Dasa Lord will subrule half of the period. The subrulership further goes to planets, as under: one third to that in the 5th/9th from the Dasa Lord; one seventh to that in the 7th from the Dasa Lord and one fourth to that in the 4th/8th with reference to Dasa Lord.

2-3. The sub-Lords will ripen the sub-period effects according to their own nature. Should there be more than one planet in the Houses specified above, the strongest of them will rule over the sub period (and not others). The sub periods of benefics will yield benefic results, while those of malefics will give inauspicious effects. According to some authorities, planets in Angles will first lord over the sub-periods followed by those in Panaphara (2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th) and Apoklima (3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th)

4. According to Satyacharya, the sub periods will rule according to the orders of strength in case there is more than one planet in one House.

5. Take the fractions (as mentioned in Sloka 1) and reduce them to equivalent fractions with a common denominator.

The sub periods will be arrived at, when the various aliquots are converted into years within the main Dasa and divided by a common factor.

6-7. Planets, that are conjunct the major Lord will cause confinement and loss of wealth in their sub periods. If, however, the major Lord is in an Angle, or in a Trine from the Ascendant, there will be great happiness.

If a malefic is in the 6th, or the 8th in aspect to another malefic placed in a malefic's Sign, death will come to pass. In the Dasa of a planet, that is inimical to Ascendant Lord and in the sub period of the Ascendant Lord himself, there may be death, according to Satya.

Thus ends the 43rd Ch. entitled “EVIL EFFECTS OF DASAS” in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Ch. 44. Antidotes For Evils Of Dasas
1-3. If at the time of commencement of a Dasa, even, if one planet occupies the divisions of a benefic, or of an intimate friend and is aspected by a benefic, the evils due to come out of the said Dasa will disappear. If the Lord of the Dasa is not strong enough to cause evil, while the planet functioning, as an antidote (as stated in the previous Sloka) is stronger, the evils are then surely destroyed. Even, if a single planet occupies its exaltation Sign, Moolatrikona Sign, or own Sign and is aspected by a benefic, or is conjunct a benefic, at the start of a Dasa the evils of the Dasa are nullified.

Thus ends the 44th Ch. entitled “ANTIDOTES FOR EVILS OF DASAS” in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Should five heavenly bodies occupy their exaltation Signs the native will be famous, be a king's patron and be very rich.

When six planets are posited in their exaltation Signs, the person will be a king, be charitable, honourable and endowed with many conveyances.

When all are in their respective exaltation Signs, the native will be an emperor ruling over the land surrounded by seas.

27-31. EFFECTS OF MORE PLANETS IN MOOLATRIKONA SIGNS. If two planets be so placed, as to be in Moolatrikona Signs, the native will be a householder contributing to the growth of his race, be pre-eminent and famous.

When three planets are similarly posited one will be quite wealthy and will head a group of men, or villages.

If four planets occupy their Moolatrikona Rāśis, the native will be very wealthy, will receive royal honours and be dear to all.

Should five be so placed, as they are in Moolatrikonas one will be a protector, be principal among men, will head an Army, town and royal treasury, be a householder and be very happy. With six planets disposed in their Moolatrikona Rāśis, though one may belong to a cowherd's race, he will be endowed with learning, charitability and various kinds of wealth, will acquire a kingdom and be famous.

If seven are in their Moolatrikona Rāśis, one will become a king, be endowed with wealth, wife, strength, learning and be skillful in archery.

32-34. EFFECTS OF MORE PLANETS IN OWN HOUSES. If two planets are in their own Houses at birth, one will be important in his race, be honoured by his relatives and be fortunate.

Three planets occupying own Houses indicate growth of the dynasty (i.e. birth of children), acquisition of wealth, position and fame.

If four planets occupy their own Houses, one will be famous, will perform significant acts and will lead over men and cities.

If five planets be placed in their own Houses, the native will be equal to a king, be endowed with abundant quadrupeds, lands and females.

If six planets are in their own Houses, one will acquire famous titles, abundant wealth, relatives and honours and one born in a royal family will become, a ruler.

If seven planets be so placed one will be a king of kings and will conquer his enemies.

35-37½. EFFECTS OF MORE PLANETS IN FRIENDLY HOUSES. If two planets occupy their friendly Sign, the native will be endowed with the company of friends and will have good conduct.

If three are so, one will patronize his relatives, be endowed with good qualities and be pre-eminent.

If four are so, one will honour Brahmins and Gods, be skillful and be famous.

If five are so, one will serve the king, be wealthy and be chief of men.

When six are so, one will have wide enjoyments, abundant conveyances and wealth and be equal to a king.

With seven planets in such placement one will have many servants, many conveyances, paraphernalia and be a king.

38-41. EFFECTS OF MORE PLANETS IN FALL. If two planets occupy their Signs of fall, one will be mean in thoughts and be very irascible.

Three being so, he will be foolish, not virtuous, be poor and be a servant.

Four being so, he will be indolent, be devoid of (useful) deeds and be a servant.

Five being so, he will be bereft of a house and a female and be a servant.

Six being so, he will be tormented by fear and labor and be emaciated.

All being so, he will eke out his food by begging, be devoid of everything and will wear torn robes, or will wander without clothes.

42-45. EFFECTS OF MORE PLANETS IN INIMICAL CAMPS. If there are two planets, that are placed in inimical sings one will be miserable and ever fond of quarrels and be subjected to humiliation.

With three such planets he will be tormented by many expenses and miseries and will lose wealth in spite of hard labor.

With four being so placed, he will be at a loss in regard to his near and dear and wealth.

Five heavenly bodies in such a state indicate, that the native will be troubled by many evils.

With six planets in inimical camps, he will be very miserable.

If seven planets are in their inimical Signs, the native belongs to a loathsome family and will be devoid of food, robes, beds etc.

Thus ends the 45th Ch. entitled “EFFECTS OF PLANETARY DIGNITIES” in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Ch. 46. Female Horoscopy
l. Whatever horoscopic effects have been stated for males are equally applicable to females too. Explained in this Ch. are rules peculiar to the fair sex.

2. IMPORTANT HOUSES. From the 8th House, her widowhood can be deduced, while the Ascendant deals with her physique, the 7th House with her husband's good fortunes and the 5th House with her offspring.

3-4. THE MOON AND ASCENDANT. If the Moon and the Ascendant are both disposed in even Signs, the female will be virtuous and extremely good-looking. Should these two be in aspect to auspicious planets, she will be endowed with ornaments and virtues. In case these two occupy odd Signs, she will be akin to a male in appearance and in disposition. With these two receiving aspects of malefics, she will be sinful and bereft of virtues.

5. TRIMSAMSA POSITIONS. Note the stronger of the Moon and the Ascendant. Whoever of the two is placed in the Trimsamsa of Mars, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, or Saturn, such effects will come to pass, (as detailed below).

6-10½. EFFECTS OF THE MOON/ASCENDANT IN VARIOUS TRIMSAMSAS. If it is a Sign owned by Mars, the Trimsamsa of Mars denotes a harlot, that of Venus a female devoid of virtuous history, that of Mercury one with cunning disposition, that of Jupiter a chaste lady and that of Saturn one in servitude. Should a Sign of Mercury house the Moon/the Ascendant in the Trimsamsa of Mars, the female will be cunning, in the Trimsamsa of Venus one with high degree of lust, in the Trimsamsa of Mercury a chaste girl, in the Trimsamsa of Jupiter a virtuous housewife and in that of Saturn impotent. If it is a Sign of Venus, the Trimsamsa of Mars denotes a female with wicked nature, Venusian Trimsamsa one with fame for her virtues, Mercurian Trimsamsa skillful, Jupiterian Trimsamsa a virtuous female and Saturn's Trimsamsa a woman given in marriage, as a second wife. In the Sign owned by the Moon the Trimsamsa of Mars bestows her freedom not due to a housewife, Venusian Trimsamsa will make her unchaste, Mercurian Trimsamsa will bestow skill in arts, Jupiterian Trimsamsa will make her quite virtuous and in Saturn's Trimsamsa she will betray her husband. In Leo the Trimsamsa of Mars will make the female garrulous, Venusian Trimsamsa chaste, Mercurian Trimsamsa male-natured, Jupiterian Trimsamsa a queen and Saturn s Trimsamsa fallen.

11-13. TRIMSAMSA EFFECTS (continued). In a Sign of Jupiter the Trimsamsa of Mars will make her a gentlewoman with many (of the seven principal) virtues, the Trimsamsa of Venus a female with evil speech, the Trimsamsa of Mercury one with knowledge, the Trimsamsa of Jupiter one with many virtues and the Trimsamsa of Saturn a female desiring limited physical union. Lastly in a Sign owned by Saturn, a Trimsamsa of Mars will make one servant, that of Venus intelligent, that of Mercury cruel and devoid of conduct, that of Jupiter a chaste lady and that of Saturn himself one addicted to base men.

14. BEASTLY LUST OF A FEMALE. When Venus and Saturn are in mutual aspects in the case of a birth in Taurus, or Libra Ascendant with Saturn's Navāńśa, the female concerned burnt with sexual lust will unite with a woman playing the role of a male. Venus and Saturn should simultaneously be in exchange in Navāńśas owned by them.

15-17. THE 7th HOUSE. Should the 7th House be vacant, her husband will be a contemptible fellow. With the said House bereft of aspect of a benefic, he will be bereft of strength. He will be disposed to living in other places, if the 7th House is a Movable Sign. He will be a eunuch with Mercury, or Saturn in the 7th House. She will be discarded by her husband, if the Sun is in her 7th House. Mars in the said House will cause early widowhood, while Saturn in the 7th with malefic aspects will make her old soon. Again she will be given up by her husband with malefics being weak and combust in the 7th receiving aspects from malefics. Benefics and malefics combust in the 7th will give away the woman native in second marriage.

18. UNCHASTITY. If Venus and Mars exchange their divisions, the female will go after other males. If the Moon be simultaneously in the 7th House, she will join others with consent of her husband.

19. MOTHER AND DAUGHTER. If a Sign of Mars, or Saturn be ascending with Venus and the Moon in it in aspect to malefics, the female along with her mother may be deemed unchaste.

20. MISCELLANEOUS. If the 7th House falls in a Navāńśa of Mars and be in aspect to the Moon (Saturn, according to some texts), the female will have a diseased vagina. A Navāńśa of Venus denotes a fortunate female, who will be dear to her husband.

21-24. EFFECTS OF RULERS OF 7th·HOUSE/NAVĀŃŚA. If the 7th House, or its Navāńśa be ruled by Saturn, the female's husband will be old and foolish. The ruler ship of Mars in such a case will give a husband, who will be addicted to other women and be irascible. If Venus heads the 7th House, or its Navāńśa the husband will be very beautiful and be fortunate. The husband will be skillful and knowledgeable, if Mercury be such a planet. A sexually tormented husband, who will, however, be soft in disposition will be bestowed by the Moon in such circumstances. The husband will be virtuous and be a conqueror of the five senses, if Jupiter rules the 7th House, or its Navāńśa. Leo, as the 7th House, or the 7th Navāńśa will indicate an industrious and a very intelligent husband. Thus the effects relating to the rulership of the 7th House and 7th Navāńśa be declared in respect of males.

25-26. EFFECTS OF PLANETS IN THE ASCENDANT. She will be jealously disposed and be happy with Venus and the Moon in the Ascendant. Mercury replacing Venus in the said Yoga will make the female happy, skillful in arts, virtuous and modest. If Mercury and Venus are together in the Ascendant, the female will be beautiful, fortunate and skillful in arts. Benefics in the Ascendant will endow a female with servants, happiness and robes, while malefics give adverse effects in regard to these.

27. EFFECTS OF THE 8th HOUSE. Malefics in the 8th will cause widowhood. This will occur in the Dasa periods of the Lord of the Navāńśa occupied by the 8th Lord. A benefic in the 2nd will, however, cause the female's death in this Yoga, instead of widowhood.

28. LIMITED PROGENY. If the 5th House be one of Virgo, Scorpio, Taurus and Leo receiving the aspect of a benefic, there will be limited number of children Alternatively, the said 5th House may be conjunct a benefic, or the Moon.

29. FEMALE WITH MASCULINE DISPOSITION. Should Mercury, Venus and the Moon be in the Ascendant and be weak, while Saturn has moderate strength, as the rest are strong, the female concerned will be akin to a male in appearance and in acts. The Ascendant should in this case necessarily be an odd Sign.

30. TAKING TO RELIGIOUS ORDER. A female will be initiated into a religious order, if a malefic is in the 7th House, while the 9th House is occupied by any planet. The order will relate to the planet in the 7th House.

31. VEDIC EXPONENT. If strong Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, or the Moon be in the Ascendant identical with an even Sign, the female will be a teacher/exponent of Vedas (or be a follower of Vedanta Philosophy). And she will be an expert in interpretation of various Shastras.

32. APPLICATION. Whatever has been stated in this Ch. should be wisely applied to females relating to their births, selection of grooms, marriage and query. These effects are applicable to their husbands also.

Thus ends the 46th Ch. entitled ‘ FEMALE HOROSCOPY” in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Ch. 47. Aphorisms of Death
1. REASONS OF DEATH. If the 8th House is occupied by any planet from the Sun to Saturn, the reason for death in the same order will be fire, water, weapon, fever, indigestion (or constipation), thirst and hunger. According to the 8th House being a Movable, Fixed, or Dual Sign, the place of death will be a foreign place, own place, or on the way.

2. Death may be due to the imbalance of that humour belonging to the planet aspecting the 8th House. If there is no planet in the 8th House, the aspecting one may indicate the kind of death. If many are thus related, the strongest one will prevail.

3. DEATH BY DROWNING, FALL ETC. If the 10th and 4th are occupied by the Sun and Mars, the native will die due to fall from hills. If the 10th, 7th and 4th Houses are occupied by Mars, Mercury and Saturn, it may be due to fall in a well. Death due to imprisonment will follow, if the Luminaries are placed in Virgo in aspect to malefics. The end will be by drowning, if Pisces is occupied by the Sun and the Moon.

4-5. DEATH BY FIRE ETC. If the Moon and Saturn, respectively, are in Capricorn and Cancer, death will be due to affliction of stomach. If the Moon be hemmed between malefics and occupies a Sign of Mars, fire/weapons will cause death. Death will be certainly inflicted by dryness of blood, if the Moon is in Virgo hemmed between malefics.

6-7. DEATH BY HANGING ETC. If the Moon in Capricorn, or Aquarius be hemmed between benefics, death will be due to hanging, fire, or fall, which is doubtless according to Chanakya. The same effect will come to pass, if the 5th and 9th Houses are occupied by malefics in aspect to malefics. If the drekkana of the 8th House be one of Pasa, Sarpa and Nigala, death will be reticent.

8. DEATH DUE TO A FEMALE. If the Sun be in Pisces Ascendant, while the Moon is in the 7th (in Virgo), or in the 2nd in Aries, or in the 5th in Cancer, a female will be reason for the native's end.

9. DEATH DUE TO A TRIDENT'S HIT. If the 4th House is occupied by Mars, or the Sun, while Saturn is conjunct weak Moon in the 10th House and malefics are in the Ascendant and its Trines, hit of a trident will cause the end.

10. DEATH BY HIT OF WOOD. If the Sun is in the 4th, while the Moon devoid of strength is in the 10th along with Mars, or in aspect to Saturn, the native will be hit by a log.

11. DEATH BY HIT OF A CLUB etc. If weak Moon, Mars, Sun and Mercury along with Saturn are in the 10th, 8th, 4th and Ascendant (in any way), the subject will have his end due to a club beat. If these planets fill the 10th, 9th, 5th and Ascendant, death will be by smoke, fire, confinement, or a blow of fist.

12. DEATH DUE TO ROYAL WRATH. If the 4th, 7th and 10th Houses are occupied by Mars, the Sun and Saturn, death will be due to weapon, fire, or royal wrath.

13-14. DEATH DUE TO INSECTS, INTOXICANTS AND MACHINERY. One's end will be due to insects, if the 10th, 4th and 2nd Houses at his birth are occupied by Mars, the Moon and Saturn. If the 10th House is constellated by the Luminaries and Mars, the native will end his life on account of intoxicants, or fall from height. Machinery will be the source of one's death, if the 7th House is occupied by Mars, as the trio of weak Moon, Saturn and the Sun afflict Ascendant by occupation.

15-16. DEATH IN FILTHY SURROUNDINGS. One will die amidst ordure, if Mars is in Libra, the Sun in Aries/Scorpio and the Moon in Capricorn/Aquarius. The Sun, weak Moon and Mars in the 8th, 10th and 4th Houses, will kill one amidst excrement. So says Siddhasena.

17-18. DEATH BY THIRST, WEAPONS AND BIRDS. If the 8th House contains both the weak Moon and Saturn in aspect to strong Mars, the subject will die due to spleenary disorders, colics, thirst, or weapons. The Sun and Mars in the 7th, while Saturn occupies the 8th and the Moon the 4th, one's death will be caused by birds.

19. If the Ascendant, 8th, 5th and 9th Houses are occupied by the Sun, Mars, Saturn and the Moon, death will be due to fall from a hill, hit of a weapon, or fall of a wall etc.

20. Yavanas indicate, that the place of death will correspond to the Navāńśa Lagna Lord. The aphorisms stated in this Ch. should be suitably interpreted according to other aspects and other conjunctions.

21. The duration of the state of loss of consciousness (or insensibility, delusion, pain etc.) will correspond to the portion elapsed in the radical Ascendant. The duration will remain doubled and trebled according to the Ascendant Lord, or a benefic aspecting the Ascendant.

22. KHARA DREKKANA. The 22nd decanate from the Ascendant will denote the nature of one's death. For example, by the nature of its Lord, (i.e. the humour, place etc.)

23-24. EFFECTS OF ARIES DECANATES AS RELATED TO DEATH. If the first decanate of Aries be the 22nd decanate from the Ascendant and be in aspect to a malefic the native's death will be due to water (i.e. drowning etc.), snake, poison, or bilious imbalances. If the 2nd decanate of Aries be so related, water, insects, ice and forests will cause death. The 3rd decanate of Aries denotes tanks, well etc.

29-30. DECANATES IN CANCER. If the 22nd decanate is the first decanate of Cancer, the reason of death will be a crocodile (or a shark), wine, thorn, or dreams. The second decanate will cause end by beating, or by consuming of poison. The terminating decanate indicates death by respiratory diseases, urinary diseases (viz. gleet, diabetes etc.), spleenary disorders, affliction to blood, or by swooning caused by excessive labor.

31-32. DECANATES IN LEO. The 22nd decanate identical with the first decanate of Leo will cause one's end due to water, poison, or diseases of the foot. The second decanate of Leo indicates death by diseases caused by water, or movements in forests. The last decanate thereof will bring one's end through poison, weapons, calumny, or fall from heights.

33-34. DECANATES IN VIRGO. Should the death decanate be the first decanate in Virgo, one's life will end due to diseases of the head, or by wind, (gale, hurricane, or outburst of violent wind etc.,) The middle decanate in Virgo will cause death by snake-bites, or in hills, forts, forests etc., or by the son of a king. The concluding decanate in Virgo will bring death by camels, asses, weapons, water, deep pits, females and unhealthy eating and drinking.

35. DECANATES IN LIBRA. When the 22nd decanate at birth is held by the first decanate of Libra, death will be through a female, or quadrupeds, or fall from heights. The middle decanate of Libra denotes end on account of stomachial diseases, while last decanate indicates snakes, or animals living in water, as a source of death.

36-37. DECANATES IN SCORPIO. The first decanate in Scorpio, if designated, as the 22nd decanate at birth, poison, weapons, females, (unhealthy) food and drinks will bring one's death. The second decanate in Scorpio indicates death through robes, weights, falls and diseases. The last decanate of Scorpio will inflict death by being stoned, or by breakage of shank bones.

38-39. DECANATES IN SAGITTARIUS. The first decanate of Sagittarius being the 22nd decanate at birth, denotes, that death will be due to various windy disorders, or due to diseases of the anus. The second decanate will cause one's end to poison, or faults of elders, or windy diseases. The concluding decanate will inflict death in water, or through abdominal disorders.

40-41. DECANATES IN CAPRICORN. The opening decanate of Capricorn will bring death through royal torture, or through tigers. The middle decanate will inflict death on account of damage to thighs, or through creatures/animals living in water, poison, snake, fire, weapons, robbers, fever and living beings other than human beings. The last decanate will bring end through a female.

42-43. DECANATES IN AQUARIUS. The first decanate in Aquarius will bring death through females, water, hills, elephants and stomachial disorders. The middle decanate denotes one's end through miseries caused by a female, venereal diseases etc., while the third decanate will cause death through copulation, facial diseases and quadrupeds.

Thus ends the 51st Ch. entitled “EFFECTS OF NAVĀŃŚAS (lost horoscopy)” in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Ch. 52. Lost Horoscopy
1. THE NATAL AYANA. If the Ascendant at the time of query (related to tracing the lost birth data) be within the first 15 of a Sign, the birth was in Uttarayana and beyond these degrees Dakshinayana.

2-3. BIRTH RITU ETC. The strongest of the planets in the Prashna Lagna indicates the Ritu (season) at birth. Should there be none in the Ascendant, the Lord of the ascendental decanate is the ruler of Ritu at birth. Should there be a clash in the Ayana and Ritu arrived at, the Ritu Lords arrived should be interchanged thus: the Moon for Venus, Mercury for Mars and Jupiter for Saturn. The respective month of the Ritu is decided depending on the first, or second half of the decanate being Ascendant. The degrees elapsed in the decanate will be to the knowledge of the natal Tithi. Some say, that this will lead to locating the natal Sun.

4-9. OTHER NATAL FACTORS. The query Ascendant be multiplied by 2 and divided by 5 to get the natal Jupiter's placement. This should be adjusted to actual placement guessing the native's age approximately, by increasing, or decreasing multiples of 12. If the query Ascendant is in a day Sign, declare birth during night. Otherwise, the contrary prevails. The degree elapsed in the query Ascendant will lead to the knowledge of elapsed portion of night, or day, as the case may be. Out of the query Ascendant, the 5th and the 9th therefrom will indicate the natal Rāśi (Moon Sign), the strongest of the three prevailing. The parts of the body, viz. head etc. touched by the querist at the time of query will also indicate the Moon Sign at birth. Alternatively the distance between the query Ascendant and the query Moon may be added to the query Moon to get the position of the natal Moon. This does not apply to the Moon in Pisces at the time of query, (i. e. the natal Moon is in Pisces itself). The Navāńśa Lagna at the time of query may also be the natal Ascendant. The number of decanates between the query Ascendant and query Sun, when added to the query Sun, will yield the natal Ascendant. The longitude of the planet in the query Ascendant should be multiplied by the figure indicated by Chayangula (length of shadow) at that time. This should be divided by 12, the remainder of which will indicate natal Ascendant.

10-11. POSITION OF THE QUERIST. The following positions of the querist will indicate the natal Ascendant. Standing, lying on the bed, sitting, or getting up will, respectively, denote the first, 4th, 7th, or 10th from query Ascendant becoming natal Ascendant.

12. PERSONAL NAME. The name formally given by parents to the native will indicate the natal star. Multiply the Matras (units) of the given name by 2 and add to it the Chayangula length. Divide this by 27 and the remainder, when counted from Dhanishta will lead to the knowledge of birth star.

13-15. ANOTHER METHOD. Note the longitude of the query Ascendant. It should be multiplied by 10, if the Ascendant is Leo, or Taurus, by 8 in case of Gemini, or Scorpio by 7 in case, or Aries, or Libra, by 5 in case of Virgo and Capricorn, while for the rest of the Signs by the number denoted, when counted from Aries. (That is 4 for Cancer, 9 for Sagittarius, 11 for Aquarius and 12 for Pisces). If the Ascendant is occupied by Jupiter, the Ascendant converted into minutes of arc be multiplied by 10, if occupied by Mars by 8, if by Venus by 7 and, if by others by 5. Both the products so multiplied be added together. This product by multiplied again by 10 to know the year, Ritu and month; by 7 to know the Tithi and by 5 to arrive at Navāńśa Lagna and Ishta Ghati (birth time) and be, respectively, divided by their individual dividers (i.e. 120 for year, 2 for Ritu, 15 for Tithi and the like). Addition, or reduction of 9 may be made in case of anomalistic answers.

16. I have explained lost horoscopic rules, as expounded by Yavana, Bhadasana etc. But some of their rules are ambiguous. The student better understand using his judgement.

17-21. LOST HOROSCOPY BASED ON MOON. Just as the ascending degree helps trace back the lost details, the Moon Sign may also be used. If the Moon Sign at the time of query be a night Sign, natal Moon was in a day Sign and vice versa. Note in what quarter of the Sign is the Moon at the time of query. Proportionately understand the natal Moon during day, or night, as the case may be. Multiply the query Moon by the same Rāśi multiplication factor, as explained supra and, if necessary by planetary multipliers, as applicable. Multiply the resultant product (arrived by adding the two) by 7 and divide by 27. The remainder will represent the birth star counted from Aswini. In case of rectification by adding 9 the counting is from Moola and, if subtraction of 9 is done count from Makha. The pre-division product (i.e. the product before dividing by 27, as above) should be processed variously, as suggested earlier to know the Ritu, month, Tithi etc. at birth.

Thus ends the 52nd Ch. entitled “LOST HOROSCOPY” in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Ch. 53. AshtakaVarga
1. In order to evaluate the auspicious and inauspicious effects in day-to-day life due to planetary transits, Yavanacharyas have explained AshtakaVarga (which are detailed below).

2. THE SUN'S ASHTAKAVARGA. The Sun contributes benefic dots in his Ashtaka Varga, as under. From his own self in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th Signs; from Mars and Saturn in similar Signs; from the Moon in the 3rd, 6th, 10th and 11th Signs; from Jupiter in the 5th, 6th, 9th and 11th Signs; from Venus in the 6th, 7th and 12th Signs; from Mercury in the 3rd, 5th, 6th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th Signs and from the Ascendant in the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 10th, 11th and 12th Signs.

6. THE ASHTAKAVARGA OF JUPITER. Jupiter's AshtakaVarga gains auspicious points, as under. From the Sun in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th Signs; from the Moon in the 2nd, 5th 7th, 9th and 11th Signs; from Mars in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th 10th and 11th Signs; from Mercury in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 9th, 10th and 11th Signs; from his own self in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th, 10th and 11th Signs; from Venus in the 2nd, 5th, 6th, 9th, 10th, 11th Signs; from Saturn in the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 12th Signs and from the ascending Sign in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th, 10th and 11th Signs.

7. THE ASHTAKAVARGA OF VENUS. Mark benefic dots in the following places. From the Sun in the 8th, 11th and 12th Signs; from the Moon in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th, 11th and 12th Signs; from Mars in the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 9th, 11th and 12th Signs; from Mercury in the 3rd, 5th, 6th, 9th and 11th Signs; from Jupiter in the 5th 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th Signs; from his own self in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th Signs; from Saturn in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th Signs and from the ascending Sign in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th and 11th Signs. This is called the AshtakaVarga of Venus.

8. THE ASHTAKAVARGA OF SATURN. Saturn's AshtakaVarga is prepared by inserting benefic dots in places, as denoted below. From the Sun in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th, 10th and 11th Signs; from the Moon in the 3rd, 6th and 11th Houses; from Mars in the 3rd, 5th, 6th, 10th 11th and 12th Signs; from Mercury in the 6th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th Signs; from Jupiter in the 5th, 6th, 11th and 12th Signs; from Venus in the 6th, 11th and 12th Signs; from his own self in the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 11th Signs and from the ascending Sign in the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 10th and 11th Signs.

9-10. The places mentioned above are auspicious for the various planets and the others are inauspicious. Planets transiting Signs with more benefic dots will reveal auspicious results, while inauspicious results will come to pass in case of transits in Signs with less benefic dots. Benefic results will be predominant, if these Signs happen to be exaltation, own, friendly etc. and malefic effects will be ordinary. Similarly in debilitation/inimical Signs, malefic results will be more and benefic effects will be ordinary. In giving transit effects, the Sun and Mars will be effective, while in the beginning of the Sign, Jupiter and Venus, while in the middle of the Sign and lastly Saturn and the Moon, while in the end of the Sign. Mercury is effective in his transit through the whole Sign.

Thus ends the 53rd Ch. entitled “ASHTAKAVARGA” in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Ch. 54. Effects Of AshtakaVarga
1. Draw 13 horizontal lines intersected by 9 parallel (horizontally) lines (thus getting 96 squares) noting the names of the 12 Signs from Aries onwards in a rightward manner and the names of the 7 planets and Ascendant in the left hand side vertical columns. Mark the benefic dots for each planets' AshtakaVarga and malefic points (where benefic points are absent), as per the positions told earlier.

10-12. May the astrologers be pleased with the Science of Astrology thus described by Kalyana Varma. Ancestors, like Paulasa, Vasishta, Romasa, Yavana, Badarayana, Sakthi, Atri, Bharadwaja, Viswamitra, Guna, Agnikesa, Garga, Parashara, Jeevasarma and a host of others have authored elaborate texts on astrology. The science of astrology thus deals with the good and bad in stock for an individual with Chitragupta (the official record keeper of Yamathe God of Deathnoting down the virtues and vices of mankind).

Thus ends the 54th Ch. entitled “EFFECTS OF ASHTAKAVARGA” in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.

Ch. 55. Manifold Births
1. Acharya Kanaka's school of thought dealing with ‘Manifold Births' is narrated in this Ch. for the pleasure of the astrologers and the common folk.

2. Lord Brahma created this Universe at a time, when Cancer was ascending with its Lord and in aspect to Jupiter, while the other 5 planets were in their own Signs. Should one have a similar radix, he will rule over the three worlds enjoying the company of the celestial dames.

3. The Science of astrology delineates the immovable and the movable through respective differences of time, omens, form etc.

4-5. If all the malefics be with strength, while benefics be bereft of it, one of the Viyoni (Viyoni Rāśis are Rāśis other than Gemini, Virgo, Libra, Aquarius and the first half of Sagittarius) be Signs ascending with Mercury and Saturn be in Angles, or in aspect to the Ascendant, the birth will be of a creature other than human being. The birth will correspond to the Dwadasamsa of the Ascendant, or of the Moon prevailing at Adhana, or in the radix.

6-9. The sages have explained the hue, form etc. of the manifold births based on planetary conjunctions and aspects, which I narrate below. The Zodiac personified signifies the several limbs of non-human species, as under: Ariesface, Taurusneck, Gemini and Piscesshoulders and forelegs, Cancer and Aquariusback, Leo and Capricornforelegs, Virgo and Sagittariushind legs, Libraanus and Scorpio tail and genital organ. The right side limbs are denoted by Signs Gemini to Libra, while left side by Signs Scorpio to Pisces.

10-12. The strongest Sign, or the strongest Navāńśa ascending will indicate the hue of such birth. If the Ascendant has a strong planet in it, the hue of the animal and the wounds on its body will correspond to such planet. If a planet is in its own Rāśi/Navāńśa, such effects will be unmixed, while the one in other's Sign/Navāńśa, will give a rough version of the hue. The animal will have a mark on its back corresponding to the hue of the planet in the 7th House, or the one aspecting the 7th House. If there are many related thus, the hues of the mark will be equally many, the prime effects being from the strongest of the lot.

13-14 The hue of the animal based on the occupant of the Ascendant will be: Jupiteryellow, Moonwhite, Venus variegated, Sun/Marsred, Saturn black, Mercury grass-green. If the planet aspecting the Ascendant be in its own Sign and other's Navāńśa, or vice versa, the hue obtainable will be golden.

15-16. The planet in the Ascendant will be capable of giving such hue corresponding to the phenomena it is influenced by, viz. Parigha, rainbow, cloud, Parivesh etc. Otherwise, the planet will give the hue due to its nature alone.

17-18. If the Ascendant has in it a bird decanate (the first ones of Aquarius and Leo and the second ones of Gemini and Libra), or a Movable Navāńśa (Aries Navāńśa and the Navāńśas angular thereof), or Gemini Navāńśa/Virgo Navāńśa and be in aspect to Saturn birds residing on lands will be born. In a similar case, the aspect of the Moon denotes births of birds dwelling in water. If a water resorting Sign be on the Ascendant in aspect to a strong planet, birds related to water will be born. Similarly land-resorting Signs in aspect to strong planets indicate birds of land. The hue of the bird will correspond to the planet concerned.

19. Birth of trees is indicated, if the Ascendant, Sun, Jupiter and the Moon are devoid of strength, while others are with strength. Land resorting Signs in the Ascendant indicate trees growing on land, while water resorting Signs indicate plants etc. coming out of water.

20-21. If the Lord of rising Navāńśa be the Sun, trees (or plants in this context) with hard, or strong trunk/stem will be born. The Moon denotes ones milky and soft; Jupiter fruitful, Marsbitter and thorny, Saturnunproductive and useless (to mankind); Venusthe ones yielding flowers and Mercuryunfruitful.

22-23. If the said Lord of Ascendant in Navāńśa be a natural malefic being in the company of a benefic, a sub-standard tree on excellent land is denoted, while in the case of a benefic being Ascendant Lord in Navāńśa and being in the company of a malefic, the reverse is truei.e. an excellent tree on waste land. If there is a mix in the above planetary description, both the land and the born will be of a mixed nature Watery planets indicate plants growing in water, while land-resorters denote trees etc. growing on earth.

24. Note how many Signs away is the Navāńśa Lagna Lord from the ascending Sign. So many will be the trees in number to be born. Similarly infer by the number denoted between Navāńśa Ascendant and the planet's Navāńśa position.

25-26. Manifold birth is indicated, if benefics are in their own Navāńśa being bereft of strength, while malefics with strength are in their own/other malefics' Navāńśas. Such birth is destroyed, if the said Navāńśa Lord occupies a weak planet's Sign, is defeated in planetary war, conjunct with, or aspected by a malefic.

21. Explained now is four kinds of manifold births, viz. those born of seeds (like plant, tree etc.), those born of womb (like quadrupeds etc.), those born in dirty places (like mosquitoes etc.) and those born of eggs (snakes, birds and the like). These are based on planetary Yogas etc. at birth.

28-29. A quadruped is born, if the Sun is in a quadruped Sign, while a weak planet is in a weak Sign. I have explained the relative rules in a brief and general manner. Now told are something surprising (more interesting) and detailed.

30-35. Should the Sun, the Moon and the Ascendant be strong in a Dwadasamsa related to a Viyoni Sign, the birth will correspond to such Dwadasamsa. If the Moon is in Aries Dwadasamsa in Aries Ascendant, birth of goats, rams etc., will take place. The other Dwadasamsas related to Aries Ascendant will give following effects: Taurus cow, buffalo; Gemini akin to a human being (like monkey, ape etc.); Cancer crab, tortoise etc., Leo tiger etc., Virgo human beings; Libra resembling human beings, Scorpio snakes etc. Sagittarius asses, horses etc., Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces Crocodile/human·being/fish etc. Similarly one can guess about trees, grass etc. Just as the various Dwadasamsas of Aries have been described, the effects for other Signs can also be understood.

36-37. The Dwadasamsa effects of the manifold births will depend on the first Dwadasamsa of a Sign and the remaining Dwadasamsa should be understood based on the first division cited. Just as a Dual Rāśi with male Navāńśa causing birth of twins in the case of human beings, in the case of other births male planets in the first Dwadasamsa being in Dual Sign etc., the number of births be decided.

38-40. In case of a living being yielding multiples at a time (like snake, hen, bitch etc.) the number of births will depend on Dwadasamsas past. Male/female should be decided by the Dwadasamsas distributed in such Signs. If the Ascendant is tenanted by the Moon/Saturn/Mercury, tortoises etc. will yield such number equaling the Dwadasamsas elapsed. Venus, Mars, Moon, or Saturn being with strength will denote Sattva, Rajas and TamoGunas of the births according to the Amsas.

41. If a (qualified) planet occupies other Navāńśas than of its own, the birth will be unnatural.

42-44. Should Scorpio ascend with a biped Navāńśa birth of snakes, rats, insects, mongoose, scorpions, snakes without poison, deer, cows etc. will take place.

45-46. The divisions of Sagittarius with aspect from Jupiter denote birth of horses, asses, camels, buffaloes etc.

47-48. Capricorn and its divisions indicate birth of forest animals, like tiger, rhinoceros, swine, wolf elephants (Sarabha apart from meaning an elephant also denotes a fabulous 8 legged animal said to be stronger than even a lion), eagles and the like.

49. Pisces (and its divisions) enjoying Jupiter's aspect relates to creatures living in deep waters, like giant fish, whale etc.

50. Aries (and its divisions) with the aspect of Mars portends births of goat, ram etc., while Taurus (and its divisions) with aspect from Venus denotes cow, bull, buffalo etc.

51. Thus have to be deduced the possibilities of births of the various creatures depending on the rising Sign with aspect of its own Lord and the divisions of the rising Sign.

52. If a Sign resorting to towns/villages (like Gemini) Ascendant with Navāńśa of Leo/Scorpio/Capricorn, such animals, though wild, as bred in villages, or townships (like elephant, bear etc.) will take their birth.

53. In the process, Navāńśas of land-resorting Signs will indicate births of animals moving on land and water-resorting Signs, animals/creatures dwelling in water.

54. If Libra be the Ascendant in aspect to Venus, a decanate of Libra denotes birth of parrots, flaming, partridge etc.

55. Peacock, cock/hen, francoline partridge, turtledove and birds living on (only) rain drops, are born, if Leo rises with Sun's aspect and with various own divisions.

56. If a Fixed Sign with aspect to Saturn obtaining various divisions of the same classifications rises, “births” of temples, houses, choultries etc. begin. The colour, structure etc. will have to be guessed with the help of aspecting planets, as explained earlier.

Thus ends the 55th Ch. entitled Manifold Births in Kalyana Varma's Saravali.
